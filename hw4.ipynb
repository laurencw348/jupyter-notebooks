    "## Part 1: Joining tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### The theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We use \"joins\" (or \"merges\") to join two tables with related information together into one table. To join two tables, they must have some \"ID\" (or identification) column in common. There can be multiple ID columns, and which you use depends on how you want to join the data (i.e. on the basis of which information?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \"Join\" is a generic term that predates and is larger than Pandas. We will use the pandas `merge()` [function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html) to achieve our joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins are perhaps most easily understood visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Visualizing joins between two tables](joins.png)\n",
    "*([Graphic source](https://dataschool.com/how-to-teach-people-sql/sql-join-types-explained-visually/))*\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you cannot see the above image, refer to `joins.png` in the folder generated by uncompressing `hw4.zip`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation IDs are the listed integers in the first column; that's the column upon which the joins are performed. White fields are missing values. Right joins are left joins but with the roles of the tables reversed (instead of the left table taking precidence, it's the right table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer, inner, left, and right joins are the most common, so focus on those. Join types are distinguished by whether or not any observations get dropped and from which table we lose information:\n",
    "1. **Outer joins** are the most conservative; they will not drop any observations from either table but the tradeoff is that they will introduce missing values instead.\n",
    "2. **Inner joins** are the most extreme in that they will only keep observations with matching IDs in *both* tables. The resulting table will not have any new missing values (that were not already in the original tables). \n",
    "3. **Left joins** will not drop any observations from the *left* table, but may drop observations from the right table if there is no matching ID in the left table. \n",
    "4. **Right joins** are the same as left joins but where the right table takes presidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the ID columns are identical between the two tables, outer, inner, left, and right joins would all result in the same final table (and with no new missing values introduced)."

    "$k$-means clustering is an easy-to-use clustering algorithm with several common implementations, including one in the `scikit-learn` package. It works best when there are [convex](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set), roughly symmetric clusters in the data. We observe such species clusters in the scatterplot from the previous problem, so we can proceed confidently with clustering over these two measurements to identify species.\n",

One reason this might be the case is that body mass does not have a strong correlation with species. In other words, different species do not necessairily have different body masses.

We therefore could have deduced that performing K-means clustering would not be successful in grouping the species into different clusters. "
