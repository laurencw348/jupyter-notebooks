    "1. You work for a public health agency that wants to identify people exposed to a disease for testing. You've been asked to build a system that will trace phone locations and estimate proximity between individuals to infer exposure.\n",

This is especially true if people's location data is stored and packanged on the system and can be sold to other companies. However, the technology could also positively impact people who's location is tracked,, as they will be notified if they are a close contact and may subsequently seek testing that they wouldn't have without this technology. This could thus improve public health, and positively impact the entire community by limiting the spread of the disease."
