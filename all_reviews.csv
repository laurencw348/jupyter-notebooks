Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"This is my first Sephora product and was recommended by a friend who is a Sephora junkie! Well, I absolutely love it. I actually didn't mean to buy waterproof, but I'm glad I did. I cry a lot at movies and stuff, lol, and this mascara is definitely waterproof! No black lines running down my face.

It's not difficult to remove with make up removerm, either. I've jused drug store brands in the past that were like plastered to my eyelashes. Ridiculous! Dior really has a great line of products.

I also use the DiorShow Mazimizer lash plumping serum before I apply the mascara, and I must say, my eyelashes are amazing! If you're looking for volume and length, I suggest both products.

I have not had any clumping with it and it doesn't seem dry to me.",01 01 2011,5 stars,Favorite! :),https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,6.19E+16
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,What can I say. I bought it in Dec. but havent had a chance to really use it. But for new years eve i tried it and yes it dose work. Theres others out there that will dry and flake off but this one didn't. This one is easy to apply and if you like to do a cat eye it is a lot easier to do with out the having too much on the brush. For sure am a buy another one when I finish the one I have now.,01 01 2011,5 stars,Best Yet,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-8.33E+17
Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Pros: Goes on easy. Looks good. Waterproof. Cons: Massive fallout. I had little dash marks. Odd formula to leave dash marks instead the usual 'flakes' from fallout. After one hour I checked it in the mirror to see how it was doing. All those little dashes and what length or volume I had at first was gone. No I did NOT rub or touch my eyes. Summary: Failure. Bringing back to the store. Hate to do it but for the price I'll find something to replace it.

skindinavia's bridal setting spray. It fulfills everything it claims. It makes your make up lasts really long and look gorgeaous.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I gave up on liquid liners years ago because they would always flake or peel off, and I would have half of my liner gone two hours into the day. This liquid liner was suggested to me by a Sephora associate, and although I was skeptical, I decided to try it out. I am SO glad I did.

This liner is AMAZING! It glides on smooth, and is easy to fix if your hand wiggles upon application. It does not fade or flake throughout the day. I've even fallen asleep a few times without removing my eye makeup, and when I woke up the next morning my eye liner was still nearly perfect.

I bought this liner about a month ago and it's still in great condition. The tip is slightly dry, but it doesn't really affect the application, and it doesn't seem to be running out yet.

One word of advice: after applying the liner above the lashline, use the thin tip to line inbetween your lashes. It makes your eyelashes look full and thick, and your eyes will instantly pop.",01 02 2012,5 stars,"Bold, Long Lasting Liner",https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-3.32E+18

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,,01 02 2016,4 stars,"I purchased this product on the recommendation of a Sephora employee (I have combination skin that tends to get more irritated during the winter), and have found that it is moderately helpful, though is causing some breakouts. It also does very little for my oily spots. However, it makes my dry patches look beautiful! However, it is a bit tacky and sticky, and takes time to sink into the skin, which is problematic if I need to slap it on and go. I love using this as a moisturizer on those days when I don't feel like wearing makeup but want glowy skin.
Solution: use two primers - one more mattifying, and this. I recommend this for people with combination skin, as well as those with normal, sensitive skin, though with a caveat. I do believe this is breaking me out, as this is the only thing that has changed in my routine.<div class=""css-xq9yyh "" data-comp=""Box""><button class=""css-nlkkp4 "" type=""button"" data-comp=""Link Box"">…read more</button></div>",https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,6.47E+18

The first day I tried this i was ready to return it because I still had oily eyelids, but there's a trick to this. IF YOU THINK THIS DIDNT WORK FOR YOU, make sure you apply it from your lash line up to your brow line and give it time to dry! If you don't apply it properly before you apply eyeshadow it's useless.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"Here is the thing...I was a little skeptical of this stuff, only because I did not know if it would be one of those things where it can not decide if it is a primer or a moisturizer. Well, in my humble opinion it is a moisturizer. With that said, I do not notice that it is a awesome primer but then again I have never looked in the mirror and said ""I have never looked more primed"" with any of my primers so I might not be the expert you need in that arena.
The product itself is light, non greasy and absorbs into the skin with ease. My skin feels soft and wonderful, I use mainly during the day but have been known to mix it with my night cream because it is so soft. I can not get away without mentioning the smell, oh my goodness, the smell. It has a distinct non overpowering coconut scent that I personally love. If you do not like the smelly then this is not for you. I know it claims to do all sorts of magical things and maybe it does and maybe it doesn't but all I know is, is that I love it. One thing...The tube/pump thing. I don't like that. Either be a tube or be a pump.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Upon reading high praise, this product was purchased. The product was advertised as being ultra-waterproof, and was tested out. The results were found to be pleasing. The product was tested out upon purchase and allowed to remain on the intended testing area, the eyelashes, for 24 hours. During the time it was subjected to a variety of every-day activities and some unusual ones. Throughout the day, and into the night, the product remained in the intended area undisturbed. The product was slept on and although some smudging was apparent after awakening, it still offered definition to the lashes. The smudging was cleared away and the makeup was tested in water. After a long shower featuring both hot and cold temperatures, what was left of the mascara on the lashes after sleeping remained in place, the lashes still defined as they were before the shower. Even liquid dial soap failed to remove the makeup. In the end, waterproof makeup remover was all that could fully remove the mascara from lashes.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,,01 05 2016,5 stars,"I have tried many mascaras and there are literally only two that I'm willing to use: this one and the Perfect Mascara Full Definition by Shiseido. They're the only one mascaras that will hold my short ad straight Asian lashes up all day. 

This one holds my curl all day whilst giving length and nice separation. With only one coat, it gives somewhat a natural look. The second coat makes a huge difference compared to just putting one coat; it can make your lashes look voluminous, but not clumpy. 

Side note: because of the numerous bristles on the brush, it's really easy to separate the lashes if you wiggle the wand properly. If you're not careful, it can look clumpy because of the fibers (that also give you length).

As far as the waterproof aspect goes, it depends on my skin's state. The mascara itself is very waterproof and hard to remove unless you have an oil based make up remover. My skin can be an oil producing factory and on those days, I get minimal smudging.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I tend to take the phrase waterproof with a grain of salt. I live in Florida after all and have yet to meet a mascara than can withstand sweat, allergies, sudden downpours, and last minute dives in the pool. Until this mascara. As some of the less positive reviews point out this mascara doesn't do much in terms of lengthening or creating voluminous lashes, but I've never come across a mascara that can withstand Florida so well. Not only does it hold up under pressure, it also comes off relatively easily with a remover. I've used waterproof mascaras that have smeared all over the place then refused to come off.

I have super straight and thick lashes to begin with and this held the curl with no problems. It makes me look like I`m wearing falsies and I don`t even need to wear eyeliner sometimes. The only problem I found is that it was a little flakey in the beginning and it kept flaking onto my cheeks. I would recommend two coats max.,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-1.27E+18
Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,,01 06 2016,5 stars,"Ive almost tried all the mascaras Sephora has to offer. Urban Decay is slaying all the other brands in this department. Perversion mascara gives length, curl and definition but smears on me bc I have oily skin so I have to top it with a waterproof one. Cannonball dose the job very well. not clumpy not chalky and the brush makes application a breeze. The only downfall is it dose flake a little bc of the fibre. But when I wear contact lenses my eyes don't get irritated.<div class=""css-xq9yyh "" data-comp=""Box""><button class=""css-nlkkp4 "" type=""button"" data-comp=""Link Box"">…read more</button></div>",https://www.sephora.com/product/cannonball-ultra-waterproof-mascara-P286303?icid2=products%20grid:p286303:product,5.82E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,,01 06 2017,4 stars,the way the tip of this liner is designed makes it very quick and easy to apply. It is long wearing and dries quickly.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,I have been on the hunt for an eyeliner that will stay put on the waterline and this is not it. The color is good and it glides on well. But it immediately started smearing off my waterline and it got smudgy on my lower lash line after just a few hours. I need something with more staying power.,01 06 2017,2 stars,Not good for waterline,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,4.39E+18

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I've always heard great things about Dior mascara so I was really excited to purchase this one. I sail almost everyday during the fall and spring so I decided that the waterproof would work best. For the first week I was pleased with the product, but then I started noticing that when used on my lower lashes it would smudge all over the place leaving me with raccoon eyes, not a good look. Once I noticed that I started using it only on my top lashes. It was volumizing and the black color did really define my lashes, but I always felt like they clumped quickly after application. I do love Dior makeup, so I'm hoping I just made a mistake with the waterproof and the normal DiorShow will be more successful.",01 07 2013,3 stars,Surprisingly mediocre mascara,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-4.82E+18
Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,This setting spray was a first time purchase for me by one of the sales associates at my Sephora location. I teach/dance salsa and sweat quite a bit and I mentioned while shopping that I needed something to try and control the streaky mess my eye makeup becomes after dancing. It works very well unless you get it in your eye (which I did) and it stung very badly and I needed to begin my makeup all over again because of the tears! As long as you do not spray it in your eyes on accident you should be good to go!,01 07 2013,4 stars,Good Makeup Staple!,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,7.40E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I never used to wear eyeliner because I couldn't apply it thin enough above my lash line. Then I saw a video on tightlining and I've been hooked ever since. I've bought a lot of different eyeliners looking for one that lasted and in the right color of blue. I found it with this eyeliner in the color Midnight in Paris. I have swatched so many eyeliners on the back of my hands!..lol Recently I was in Sephora and I swatched several different colors of this liner. One of the girls at Sephora saw me trying to wipe off my hand with make up remover and came over to help. She ended up having to use a spoolie brush to scrub off the swatches! Besides the color and staying power, I just love how easy this liner is to use. They're not too hard and they're not too soft. They just glide on easily with great color payoff. I've been debating the hot pink color. :-)",01 07 2015,5 stars,Great for Tightlining and Lasts All Day!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,5.25E+18

The tip makes it so easy to create a wing and control the thickness of application. Plus, I never worry about this rubbing off, smearing, or washing off in rain. Even though it's pricier that many other liquid eyeliners, it's so worth it! I'll continue to repurchase this! *Tips: Just make sure to store it with the tip down to prevent it from drying out too quickly. Also, once it does dry out, I still use this to then apply other gel eyeliners that come in jars.",01 07 2016,5 stars,Holy grail eyeliner,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,7.77E+18
Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,,01 07 2017,5 stars,"This primer is amazing. I have very oily lids- it took me so long to find a primer that kept my eye shadows lasting all day. It has a smooth application and provides a nice matte base for my shadows, and it doesn't leave your makeup creased. I've had days where I would wear makeup for 12  hours and seriously, my eye makeup looked as if I had just applied it. This is definitely a must for someone who has oily skin.",https://www.sephora.com/product/eyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716?icid2=products%20grid:p284716,2.41E+18

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"After reading the great reviews, I knew I had to try this mascara. I got it right before I headed to the beach and couldn't wait to try it out. Well, first day at the beach and I had mascara smearing under my eyes. It wasn't running, but I had raccoon eyes after a short while. I continued to try it throughout the vacation, but ended up with the same result. I was highly disappointed and I have no idea how other people have such great results. I do not apply a lot of mascara, just a thin coat and it did not work.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've tried so many liners (so, so many) and I've actually come back to this one due to how easy it is to apply: very precise tip that glides along smoothly and evenly. Easy to control. Doesn't snag or skip over the squinty lumps in my outer corners when I do my cat eye. And, I can do a super thin line in the inner corner of my eye and gradually thicken it to create a nice precise line. Also stays put all day, no exceptions. Only thing to watch for if you have the same liner ‘wants’ as me: it's not really black enough and find product runs out quickly – I like a thick line but can never work the thicker tipped liners with finess. When it dries up I can coax out more colour for a while if I moisten the pen on my tongue (who knows if there are some wacky side effects from that down the line ha ha ha). Yup, living on the edge for my perfect cat eye! So basically this pen is great for those like me who struggle to get that perfect line. My work-around to conserve the fluid is to use this pen to create a cat eye 'outline' then fill it in with another liner.",01 08 2014,4 stars,Makeup Bag Staple,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,2.34E+17
Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,Finally found a primer I like!! I have very dry skin and this primer hydrates my skin and makes it look brighter!

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,THE best eyeliner for the waterline!! Doesn't smudge or move around. The color I purchased was brown(out). Rich in color.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"This is such a great liner, especially for the waterline. I got it as the birthday sample. It's so impressive. I think it's better than urban decay and ardency inn because it does not move once applied. You can smudge it with shadow but unlike the other liners, it doesn't travel into the corners throughout the day and look messy. Instead of buying the full size version of this, I bought the MJ thin gel liner thinking it would be better for the waterline. Same formula, but I like the thicker pencil better because it's sturdier and actually easier to use.

Tom Ford,Emotionproof Mascara,Mascara,"This lives up to the description of emotion proof! It did not smudge or leave marks or leak down!

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I am knocking this down a star only because I don't think it is as good as their other mascaras. It is most DEFINITELY waterproof (and sweat proof, I might add, and you WILL need remover that is designed to take OFF waterproof makeup...otherwise it will be on there for days...no joke). It definitely lengthens my eyelashes but does not separate or define them as well as their other mascaras.

I've been using this since before it came in a squeeze tube (which is a huge improvement so glad they did that!) and my eyeshadow stays where I put it until I wash it off. One little dot on my finger does both eyelids. Little dot! If I use too much I get lines of beige on my eyelids, usually near the inside of my eye closest to the bridge of my nose when I rush to get out the door and once it dries it takes a wet q-tip to get it to blend, but that's user error not a product flaw.

I gave this a try and it works! I started with a clean face, oil-free moisturizer, primer, powder, blush, shadow and mascara then four sprays. Make sure you hold it away from your face like it says and close your eyes (and wait till the mascara is dry, learned that one the hard way lol). I used four sprays because I'm just that oily. When I got home that night my makeup looked great! Eight hours and hardly a sign of shine! What really sold me was when I fell asleep with my makeup on (I do not recommend this) and I was shocked, it wasn't all over my pillow and I looked slightly made up at 7am.

It smooths out the color of my eyelids, makes my eyeshadow last all day regardless of the brand, and keeps mascara and eyeliner from transferring onto the eyelid. The only things it isn't good for are for holding glittery eyeshadow (you'll need a glitter glue primer for that), and for wearing underneath fast-setting cream shadows as it makes it impossible to blend them out.

Tom Ford,Emotionproof Mascara,Mascara,"I really wanted to love this mascara and it's ""ok"". It doesn't hold the curl and the formula seems weak, not enough oomph for me. For someone who already has long, dark lashes with a good curve this would probably do the trick. I also found that it didn't hold up well in the hot/humid weather. It didn't flake or smudge but it did seem to attract moisture and became sticky feeling over the course of an afternoon walking around in the sun. I'm going to return it and look for something else. Surely one day a formula comparable to the urban decay cannonball will hit the market :(

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Trust me, I have tried a bazillion waterproof mascaras. If it's out there, I've purchased it. Some are great but expensive; others, not so much. I read other reviews on Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara and decided to give it a try and am so glad I did. I am now on my 4th tube. This mascara goes on easily--no clumping--and stands up to any kind of torment: fighting w/your loved one, frustration, rain, romantic movies, swirling snow, sweat, weddings and working out. Furthermore, it is reasonably priced and comes off easily with a little baby oil. I've even rubbed my eyes without thinking, expecting to look like a raccoon once I realized what I'd done, but the mascara did not budge. You will not be disappointed, but make sure you use either baby oil or eye makeup remover to take it off.

I have been using it for over a year now and I never have problems with creases. I have done Insanity at the end of the day and I will be dripping in sweat and yet my eye makeup has not moved! However, I expected that from any good quality primer.

Tonight I went out dancing and was wearing heavier eye makeup for Halloween and it started raining! I walked to my friend's dorm which took 10 minutes, I walked to the cab, danced all night in a hot club, and then walked to/ waited for a bus for probably 20 minutes while it was still raining. I got back to the room expecting to see my face in ruin but my eye makeup was still in place with only a minimal amount of smudging at the bottom of my eye. It was INCREDIBLE! I was absolutely drenched from rain, but my smokey eye was perfectly in place without even a little creasing. I will never go to anything else!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"So I just got back from Sephora and was very excited to try out this new eyeliner. I absolutely LOVE katVonD's products, however, this new eyeliner has been giving me quite a headache to figure out what's wrong with it OR if it's me that's not using it correctly. I love the pigmentation and everything, I tried it on the top of my hand first to see what it looked like and it looked amazing. As soon as I try it on my eyelid it felt as if the felt tip already dried out instantly. Barely anything would come out of it. I'm very sad because I love how it looks on other people. I watched first impressions of it on YouTube and it seemed like it was worth the money. Reading some reviews here I notice that I'm not the only one who's having this problem.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I loved the wand version of this and originally had the sin color with the shimmer. When I ran out, I immediately thought the new tube version would be great I wouldn't be leaving any product behind prematurely at the end and I decided to try the more matte color Eden. Now I don't know if what I'm experiencing in the review to follow is due to the color change or packaging change.

With the tube, no amount of kneading can make the consistency right. I have to squeeze a bunch out onto the back of my hand and mix together since it seems to have separated and then take the mixture and apply to my eyes for it to work. Otherwise if I just go straight from the tube it's an inconsistent oily mess that's impossible to blend on my lids and I end up with creases in a few hours.

Tried Stila on a whim, and ooooohhhhh my gosh. Not only stayed all day, but stayed looking fresh all day. But it's easy enough to wash off at the end of the day too.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I am incredibly picky when it comes to my makeup products, and I'm even more particular when it comes to my eyeliner. I had been searching for ages for just the right applicator and I have to say, the Stila pen is a great brush. It's the felt marker-kind of applicator and is super easy to use. Put it where you want it and it draws the line for you perfectly.

That being said, I have to critique it honestly. It's great for the first handful of uses, but I have noticed (after many repeat buys, mind you) that the tip of the brush dries out pretty quickly and then requires you to snip it off. It seems like a small complaint, but when the whole purpose of this eyeliner is the accuracy and easy of use of the precise point of the pen- it's kind of a hard problem to ignore. The middle of the pen continues to moisten and apply smoothy, but the dry tip is really annoying (I know: that's what she said).

The color is great and it does stay on pretty well, as long as you use eye primer. If you don't use primer, it does tend to smear if you apply it too close to where your lower lid comes into contact with your upper lid- resulting in that infuriating smear on your crease.

I wish I could choose 3.5 stars, because it is slightly better than average and is still in the top 3 eyeliners I've ever used. However, with how quickly the tip dries and crumbles as well as its tendency to smear- I must rate this a 3/5. If you do not care about the slight smearing or the applicator dryness, go ahead and just buy this eyeliner. It really is a good product, just not exactly what I'm looking for at the moment.…read more",02 02 2014,3 stars,Overall: Good,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-3.70E+18

This is a very black liner. It goes on smoothly. It's got beautiful packaging. However, it does transfer to the bottom lid on me eventually - but not right away. It DID NOT, however, give me racoon eyes.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I've tried primers from a few other brands in the past (all the most popular ones), Smashbox, Hourglass, Benefit, etc. All of them either left my skin weirdly dry and flakey (worse than before I applied it), or they were heavy for my skin and broke me out. I don't really like the feeling of silicone primers on my face so when I came across this Too Faced one, it peaked my interest.

Since I have sensitive skin, I always read a number of reviews for makeup before I buy - all I can say is, i'm so glad I took the plunge. I love it!! Not only does it prime my skin so well that my makeup glides on (my morning routine is much quicker), but it also moisturizes my skin and keeps it perfectly hydrated all day (dry spots are pretty much eliminated). It also keeps my whole face makeup looking great all day! All this without causing a single breakout.

Not to mention, it smells heavenly (a very light smell, so it doesn't linger on the skin). It feels beautiful on the skin and coming from someone who has a very difficult time finding anything 'face' related (foundation, concealer, powder), this is heaven sent for my problem skin.

It has been a long journey on the path to finding a decent liner that requires minimal effort and powerful staying power. And it has come to a stop, for now! I bought this eyeliner in Brown(OUT) and it has been pretty phenomenal. This dark brown has just enough darkness, lightness, and tiny speckles to give me a versatile look. Black is too harsh and the Ro(Cocoa) is too light. It glides on really well and lasts all day* without major smudging. The only major downfall to this, hence the 4 stars, is the sharpener. A great idea, and when used correctly, produces a sharp point for precision. But I find the product will occasionally get stuck in the sharpener and make me lose a lot of product :( I have to keep a paper clip handy to clear out the sharpener. Otherwise, love, love this product.
*I've applied many techniques to have minimal smudging throughout the day. Eye primer is a must. After applying the eyeliner, I'll add some dark brown eye shadow over it to ""fix"" it. Then, I also add some nude eye shadow to my lower lash line so the oiliness doesn't cause my eyeliner to smudge.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I am a lifelong waterproof mascara devotee. I'm always looking for a better WP mascara. Cannonball can hold it's own along with the best. 1) It glides on like a dream. No clumping 2) It holds my curl... something only the best WP formulas can manage 3) Transforms my short stumpy lashes into long lashes (my expectations are realistic, no mascara is going to make my lashes ""advertisement long"") 4) Is water-resistant, and to a degree, waterproof. Here's the thing. The effectiveness wanes after about 6 hours. At that point, the lashes dull down a bit... although I don't see any smudging or flecks of mascara wandering. The mascara just does not look as fresh as when first applied. And when splashed with water, the lashes wilt ... but when splashed with water one hour after application, lashes are fine. 6) Color is black, but could be a richer deeper black. All in all, I would give this 4.5stars. Half a point off for fading after six hours. But I will buy again.. it's a great mascara.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"If you wear make up then this product MUST be in your kit! I have tried setting sprays from big brands and they work fine, but this product is noticeably on a whole other level. When people compliment your make up for looking fresh through out the day, you know it works. 

I deal with a shiny T-Zone and make up settling into my fine lines, especially under my eyes. I've had minimal shine, my make up has barely creased, and my foundation is still solid after 10  hours. Look, you're always gonna have shine and creasing, but this product minimizes it better than anything else I've tried. 

If you still have issues with your make up staying put, you may need to look into using primer, or your current primer may not the right formula for your skin or with the foundation you've paired it with.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"First product review I’ve  ever done but it’s also  one product that I saw instant impact. I was skeptical when the TF rep recommended it but she after applied it to one side of me face, it was obvious that side of my face looked fresher, and just...better! My mom and I couldn’t say what the difference was, only that one side looked so good. My parentheses and marionette lines filled up and literally disappeared! The side with TF Hangover looked radiant and full while the other side looked dehydrated and tired. After the rep pointed It out, she applied it to the other side and what a change. (Needless to say, I bought the Primer and Setting Spray set on the spot.) 
Since I have a pore concern, I use another primer for my nose but will use TF H/O for the rest of my face. As I use this more as a skincare product than a primer I also apply some over my makeup during the day when I need a little boost of hydration and “lift” in my no go zone (parentheses and marionette lines). 
I use the setting spray after my toner in the AM for hydration and again over my makeup. 
I would def recommend both these products but if the kit is not available, go for the Hangover primer.",02 06 2019,5 stars,A skincare product above and beyond a primer!!!,https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,-8.59E+18

It's also a workable mascara; it's not thick and clumpy like most waterproof mascara. It separates my lashes great and I can put a few layers on without it clumping. It also came off easily with sephora's waterproof eye remover... Highly recommend! Now if only they would come out with a cannonball black eyeliner....

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Okay, I normally never review products due to my laziness, but this is my favorite product on Earth! I have bought this countless times and although I have tried other liquid eyeliners, this is my favorite one and I always end up going back to it. It's my holy grail liner! I cannot stress how durable this is. I'm Asian and have literally no eyelids, there is a crease going right where my eyeliner goes, so you can safely assume that any other eyeliner would crease and smudge all over the place, but this eyeliner stays put through everything. I've cried in this eyeliner and my mascara has gone everywhere, but this stayed put. I use this product almost every single day and it's so easy to do a nice, clean, crisp wing with it. The tip is pointy, although it frays after a while, and very precise, and the color pay off is amazing. The only thing that I could complain about is that it runs out kind of quickly, or maybe I just use it too much. Using it about 5-6 days a week, sometimes 7, it runs out in about 2 months. I don't mind repurchasing it every time but I wish it lasted longer. For people who use less product and less frequently than I do, it will probably last a lot longer. There are no flakes, no smudging, and it comes off easily with make up remover or wipes. It doesn't irritate my eyes or anything bad I really just think it's perfect. I've used other liquid liners that take forever to dry, but this one dries very quickly and you don't have to worry about smudges.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"A good black eyeliner pencil is difficult to find because I am super picky. I'm a die hard pencil fan & I do not like the super creamy eyeliners that are all the rage now - they seem to melt or fade quickly and are harder to work with. When I saw MJ's new line I had to try Blacquer in an effort to find a good black pencil. And a good black pencil it is! While it is creamy, it's not as creamy as some of the UD pencils (Perversion, which I absolutely cannot work with if I want a tightline). It glides on smoothly and the color is AMAZING. It's as black as Perversion but in my opinion it's prettier, it has a nice shine to it so those who like a matte finish might not like it. I love the feel of it in my hand as I'm applying it, it's luxurious yet functional. You will have some time to smudge but not much! Usually I line both eyes and then use my smudge brush but with this pencil you'll need to smudge right away. What I didn't like was while smudging, most of it came right off. It created a beautiful effect on the lower lash line but on top I had to darken it back in just a bit - no big deal at all considering. Once its set you're all done, this stuff will not move! I work 10 hour days and the staying power was incredible, I did a tiny little touch up halfway through my shift but nothing like what I usually have to do. The built in sharpener at the bottom of the pencil would be a genius idea if it worked. You have to twist the liner up to get it into the sharpener and once its in it basically does nothing. It shaved a tiny bit off the sides but did not give the sharp point I wanted. This is why I knocked off one star but all in all I am thrilled with this product and I highly recommend it.

The mascara doesn't do that well of a job defining my lashes, and I wish it would be more voluminous. Overall, I would repurchase but am currently looking for a better mascara.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I first encountered the Diorshow (nonwaterproofed) mascara in the trial form. I really really liked the mascara. It went on well and stayed most of the day. I have a HUGE problem with mascara migrating from my lashes to right under my eyes. I've tried SO many brands and I thought, since regular Diorshow stayed so well then Diorshow waterproof would be even better. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The waterproof formula ended up turning me into a raccoon within 5 minutes of application. It was a huge disappointment. Now I have to figure out how I can return this stuff because I can't use it unless I want to look like I haven't slept in a week.

That said, it still had all of the good qualities I liked with the regular Diorshow. It made my lashes look long, thick, and defined. It didn't clump and it built on itself without an issue. I already have long eyelashes so this stuff just amplifies my God given asset.

Recently, I purchased one and the quality was terrible, it would not draw a straight line and looked gray and patchy instead of the intense black I wanted.  It also didn't last very long.  I repurchased, thinking I had a bad tube, but no.  The newest one has the same problems.

I find myself closing the cap and shaking the liner several times while doing my eyes. The “ink” also doesn’t layer over itself very well.

It's amazing. I have a hard time with eyeliners because my skin is oily and I have watery eyes from allergies. This is totally worth the price.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I will start off by saying that these are one of the best eyeliners I have tried; extremely smooth application, no tugging, strongly pigmented shades, and trustworthy longevity. If I want to use an eyeliner on a day or night that I won't be able to check myself in the mirror and touch up, this is my go-to eyeliner, over nars, and over urban decay.

However! This has been strongly dependent on the color I use. I have Blacquer, Ro(cocoa), Stone(fox), Brown(out), and Luna(tic). I have found that Blacquer and Ro(cocoa) stay on the eyelids and lashline (it fades from the waterline, but has never resulted in raccoon eyes for me, and only minimal pooling in the corner of my eyes), whereas the more shimmery colors (brown(out), stone(fox), and luna(tic) ) are trickier to deal with. Once wearing luna(tic), I was able to rub the entire color off into rubbery pieces with my finger, which was disappointing. The shimmery colors also result in a bit of glitter fallout as the day goes on. Prepping the lid with either primer, or making sure whatever moisturizer you use is completely dried/absorbed, also allows the eyeliner to grab onto the lid better. I can speak from experience that josie maran argan oil moisturizers don't help; I was able to rub my eyeliner clean off when I'd applied the brand's spf moisturizer before putting on eyeliner.",03 06 2014,4 stars,longevity depends on the color,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,7.78E+18

I give it 4 stars because it didn't last that long! I only used it on weekends because I don't wear makeup during the week and it dried out pretty quickly.

It goes on pretty dewy/tacky but dries to a nice natural lightweight finish, and moisturizes nicely without feeling slick/greasy.
It helped my foundation go on smoothly and stay on during the heat and humidity. I also feel like my skin has gotten better/softer since using this.

Tom Ford,Emotionproof Mascara,Mascara,"I actually started wearing mascara again because of this product. I did not want to like this $46 mascara because THAT PRICE, but it really did stay fully on my lashes with no smudging or smearing even after walking around all day in the hot sun with my kids. I stopped wearing mascara for years because I could never find one that didn't end up under my eyes. My lashes would look good for maybe an hour, then I would have black marks under my eyes, and that's just not cute. The mascara was not the absolute best for volume or length, but it defined my lashes well enough, and most important to me, it didn't smear at all!

I bought a fresh liner the other day as my old one (third one) was finally dying. This new one, however, must have gone through some packaging issues and was dried out.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,,03 12 2014,5 stars,"So I decided to try this primer on a whim after seeing a picture of it on the Too Faced Instagram, and I am SO GLAD I DID. It's my new all-time favorite primer, and I've tried ALLLLL of them.

To begin with, I love that it's silicone-free, as I find silicone-heavy primers to be kind of creepy feeling, and they also sometimes change the texture of the makeup that goes over them. This one is super smooth and lightweight, but still smooths out my skin, and creates a perfect base for any of my foundations. I also like the fact that it doesn't have SPF, making it useful for flash photography. The texture is very light, similar to Laura Mercier moisturizing primer, but I find this does more for my skin as far as actual moisturizing than the Laura Mercier one does. It smells like coconut water, which I don't mind, though if you're sensitive to smells, you might consider a sample first to see if it will bother you. The tube/pump system works well, and so far, it's been easier to travel with than a glass bottle.

I apply my actual moisturizer, wait for it to dry while drying my hair, then apply this primer. I let the primer dry while straightening or curling my hair, then apply my makeup. I do find a few minutes of wait time between applying different products is important, and this primer dries down quickly, allowing makeup to go on evenly, and without pilling or tugging. I've used it with a variety of liquid foundations, and it works well with all of them. Particularly, it makes Armani Luminous Silk look AMAZING. My skin seems to stay moisturized moreso with this than any other ""moisturizing"" primer, and I would def. re-purchase this. Price is on the lower end of the high-end primer spectrum, so that's nice..",https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,4.39E+18

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I've been using the ""Diorshow Iconic Waterproof Mascara"" as my go-to mascara for ages now, so when my tube was running low I went back to Sephora to purchase a back up. I took a picture of the box so I knew which code to look for to ensure I picked up the right one... Well, silly me only looked at the box thinking there's no need to check inside. When I got home, to my surprise, this mascara was in the box! I was furious, but I knew it was my fault as well for not double checking, so I thought I would give this mascara a chance.

I opened the bottle to see a gigantic brush caked with mascara. Since this wasn't the the brush style I was used to, I applied it as slowly as I possibly could. Some product fell off of the brush, even after doing my best to scrape it off on the top of the tube, and went into my eye – very uncomfortable. Then as soon as I fully opened my eye, and my lashes touched my skin, the mascara smudged everywhere *sigh*.

At this point I was determined to make friends with the mascara because I wasn't planning a trip back to Sephora any time soon.

I'd say after four or five attempts with this mascara I finally made it work. I started putting this one on first as a rich, thick, and voluminous base, and then adding my original (depleted tube) on afterwards to clean it up. The sleek brush from my original mascara was the saviour here.

CONS:
This mascara cakes on, doesn't dry quickly, and clumps almost instantly with two swipes. It's also very hard to get to the eye lid without smudging this somewhere.

PROS:
It does add a lot of volume if you get the hang of it, the colour is rich and dark, and combined with a more subtle brush [afterward] it gives your eyes a nice finish – if you're able to remove the clumps.

Would I buy this again? I honestly don't think so.

tl;dr – The mascara clumps, is messy, slow to dry, and difficult to apply if you're not used to it. Does provide volume if combined with a thinner brush and you're able to remove any clumps from the lashes.",03 12 2015,3 stars,"Volume, but NOT Without the Mess...",https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-1.17E+18

It helps your eyeshadow stick: Partially True (It only helps the base shadow stick. Whatever you put on on top of the primer sticks, everything else, not so much.
It prevents creasing: False. (Any shadows applied over the base coat WILL crease after about five hours. And I'm not talking about poor quality eye shadows, I'm talking about Urban Decay eyeshadows.)
It improves the look of your eye makeup and makes the colors more vibrant: False. (It should be noted that that's not a claim of the product, but rather something several reviewers have said. That's simply not the case. Eye makeup looks exactly the same.
Provides a huge improvement over all: Marginally True. (It's a tiny improvement. Not worth $20 a pop.The eyeshadow still creases and it only aids the single base shadow.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have very mixed feelings about this mascara. Overall, I do like this mascara a lot. But it is not the holy grail. Love how this mascara applies... glides on like butter. Makes my lashes long, and does not clump. It seems waterproof, and is most definitely water resistant. But it does not have great lasting power. It loses its oomph after a few hours. My lashes don;t seem as full and droop a bit starting about three hours after applied. And this is in normal weather working in an air conditioned environment. It's the oddest thing.. never experienced this with any other mascara.

The formula is light & not clumpy so you can layer it on easily & get the desired look your after. It looked like I had fake lashes on by the time I was done layering it on for a heavy night look. First time I used it, I thought for sure it would a pain to get off because it stayed so well but it does come off easily with normal facial cleaner & hot water. But I would recommend using a waterproof eye make up remover so you dont have to tug & rub on your sensitive eye area.

As it turns out, this eyeliners turns into a sticky mess that smears all over my crease, ruins my makeup, and makes me quite irritable. I've tried using it with and without an eye primer, with powder shadows, pigment, cream shadows, a top layer of finishing powder, and nothing works.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"Believe me, I would much rather write a positive review than a negative one. I am very disappointed by this product for a number of reasons:

1. It leaks like crazy! Despite the fact that it has two lids (one clear, small plastic lid, and a larger purple lid to go over top) it constantly leaks if it's on its side. And yes, I have ensured that the lids are properly secured, but regardless, I've lost a lot of the product in my makeup bag.

2. It causes breakouts. Luckily I rarely break out, but whenever I use this product, I break out.

I pair it with Urban Decay's 24/7 liner in Whiskey which I used to tight line my upper water line (try this, it will change your life) and curl with Sephora's classic curler, which after you break it in, will never tear our lashes. I swear this mascara has made my eyelashes GROW. Even when I'm not wearing it I notice a difference. The waterproof formula holds that curl in place and doesn't clump, unlike They're Real.

The definition, color, buildable volume and length is wonderful and your lashes look great but I found that regardless of how little I put on, and whether it was top and bottom lashes, at the end of the day (sometimes just hours later) i would have black smudged under my eyes.

I was hesitant for the price, but figured Dior would be a good investment, unfortunately I will definitely try and take this back.",https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-5.58E+18

It give great definition and a little bit of length with one coat. If you want a more dramatic look, go ahead and put that second or third coat on. I will admit that you may need a eyelash comb when you get to that third coat, but it's not too bad. The formula is lightweight on my lashes and does not smudge on me (a rare thing in my world). I think this is a fantastic product, but I knocked off a star because of the price. A bit steep in my opinion but I know I'm going to keep coming back to it.

I don't have that issue with my Stila one. I can fix and adjust over the line and it'll still be perfect. I'm fed stocking up on some other colors soon!

I do find that the tip of my eyeliner does fray a bit after prolonged use but I just take sharp eyebrow scissors and snip the teeniest bit off and continue on. It's a small foam like piece... So I'm not expecting it to be stiff and perfect forever.

All in all, it's amazing eyeliner. If you love perfect wings, try this baby.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I have been using this eyeliner in black for the last 4 months and it was love at first use. First of all I want to mention that I have tried many brands from the drugstore (L'Oreal, Maybelline, Prestige) to more expensive (Clinique, Lancome, Stila , Urban Decay, Sephora)brands. I have tried pencil, liquid and gel forms of eyeliner. I have never found the right one because they always smeared, smudged, flaked or faded during the day. I had just about given up on finding the right one.

I tried this one on an afterthought.....maybe just maybe the expense was worth it? When I originally purchased it in August of 2013 there were no reviews yet written so I took a chance and after using this product for over 4 months I can now truly say that FINALLY I have hit the jackpot. I use this product every day but now I find that I don't have to constantly check myself in the mirror for those hideous racoon eyes that I had become use to seeing. I have oily eyelids. My eyelid is also hooded which makes keeping the eyeliner on very difficult. I also have sensitive allergy prone eyes which is why I don't use primer. This eyeliner goes on smoothly without tugging and stays on without me applying any primer beforehand. With my allergies comes plenty of sneezing and watery eyes. No one will believe me that this eyeliner doesn't budge when I have one of my sneezing fits.
Yes this eyeliner is expensive but to me this is godsend and worth every penny. It has even lasted unlike my eyeshadow in extreme heat and humdity.

The quality of the pencil itself is pretty good. The only negative thing that I can say is that the sharpener itself is very wimpy, with a cheap thin plasticky feel to it. I personally don't use the sharpener as I like my eyeliner more on the thicker side. I basically just run the eyeliner tip against some tissue paper if I need to clean off the excess oil before use and the pencil works like new again. The sharpener end now seems to have loosened from the pencil itself and a couple of times I found it had fallen off into my makeup bag. After having used this eyeliner everyday for the last few months it still swirls up smoothly and swirls down closed into the pencil itself without getting stuck which has happened to me several times with other brands.

It also comes off very easily when I wash my face at night when I use my Clinique Comforting Cleanser.

I never thought that I would write gushing glowing compliments on an eyeliner but this one really deserves it. I hope they never change this product because it has taken me ages to find something that I like. I am going to try the other colors and see if they perform as well as the black one. Truly..... I love this eyeliner!",05 01 2014,5 stars,The best of the best!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-4.28E+18
Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I saw a recent photo of Cameron Diaz and loved her eye makeup. When I read that she was wearing this, I immediately ordered it online. I love the richness of the brown, and while I like the idea of a little glitz/glimmer to make the eye pop, the glitter from the pencil wound up all over my face. The gel crayon went on smoothly - without pulling my eyelid like some other pencils do - but the sparkle got into my lashes/mascara and when I tried to remove it at the end of the night, I couldn't get rid of the glitter to save my life. I wish they had this coppery color with a little less glitter and more of a metallic shimmer.",05 01 2015,4 stars,Glitter Be Gone,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-7.41E+18

I usually use Lancome's grandiose water proof mascara, but it's been smudging on me :/ I stuck with it because it was the only mascara that didn't uncurl my eyelashes. I ordered this and wow, it exceeded my expectations as well as beat the grandiose! The cannonball actually dries on my lashes, when I touch my lashes there is no black smudging on my finger.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I first got this months ago when the Too Faced Cocoa Powder Foundation came out as well. I just happened to mention to the Too Faced rep that I didn't like silicone primers, so she immediately recommended this. At first, I was pretty skeptical. I have oily skin and this has no promises to keep the oil at bay. However, my skin LOVES this stuff. It makes my makeup glide on, and if I felt like it, I could probably use only this as a moisturizer-primer combo.

With my oil skin, I've stopped expecting products to totally and completely prevent oil breakthrough. What I look for is how the products perform when the oil does break through. With this, oil breaks through evenly, gives my face a nice glow, and magically prevents whatever make up on top from totally breaking down.

It gives me very beautiful lashes too. I have long lashes but now at 61 1/2 they are thinner, and less curled.
This mascara thickens them just enough to not go overboard for my age ( one coat is all I use) and it helps to curl my lashes without a curler.

Lasts all day with no smudging. This is an amazing task since all other mascaras (including waterproof) that i have tried smudge within 2 hours. If it doesn't smudge on me, it won't smudge on you!

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Ok, so I haven't tried all of the colors, but I have tried 4 of them. I usually go with a cat-eye, which means that the tip of my liner had better hold liner liquid. When the tip of your liner doesn't hold any liquid, you can't achieve the fine lines of a good cat eye look. So far I have loved all of the colors I've tried - teal, indigo, midnight, and olive. Unfortunately, the tips of the teal and indigo dry out really quickly. At first I thought it was just an anomaly but I started keeping track of how many times I used a particular color. And I only got 3 uses out of the Indigo before the tip was dried out. The base of the marker tip was still functional and had liquid in it, but what good is the base of the marker when you need the tip to draw on your liner? Teal was only slightly better, I could probably get 8 uses out of it before the tip had dried out. I'm still testing out the Midnight so I can't give you a number on it, but Olive has lasted me the longest - I've used it at least 20 times and it is still flowing nicely. Lastly, I have oily eyelinds and oftentimes liner disappears from my lids unless I use a waterproof liner and a base. This liner lasts a really long time on my eyelids. The only slightly annoying quality is that sometimes it takes a little extra effort to completely remove the liner because it will leave a faint ""halo"" of your color after you've removed it.",05 11 2014,5 stars,Some liners tips dry out quicker than others,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-5.06E+18
Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I loved how smoothly this went on. At first. Then it progressively dried out and around 3 weeks later, I noticed it tugging and skipping a lot.

Also, as with a number of automatic pencils, the tip just never got sharp enough to be as fine and precise as I prefer. On the plus side, it wore really well throughout the day and it didn't budge or smudge once it set, which is impressive considering that my eyelids are quite oily!

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I was really tired of mascaras and shadows (even hig-priced dept store brands) creasing, fading, and leaving black semi-circles on my brow line. I read numerous primer reviews online and narrowed-down this one to try. I love it! It goes on a slight nude color but quickly blends to clear. I've never used a primer, and thought some may think it is a bit thick and 'pulls' when you apply it. If you hold your lid still with the other hand it shouldn't pull too much, and once on it glides and blends smoothly. It solved my makeup probems!

So the applicator is not useful to blend, and not able to take out more primer then it's not useful!!! It was no longer creamy to blend, more liquid than cream.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I absolutely love this mascara. I have to use waterproof mascaras because my sadly super straight and wimpy lashes will only hold a curl with them. I work all day outside running after kids and swim a LOT and every ""waterproof"" mascara I have ever tried leaves ugly black smudges under my eyes. After reading a bunch a great reviews I tried this one. It gave me volume, length, the wand is great for getting clumps out, hold my curl, AND DID NOT BUDGE ALL DAY. Amazing. I will say it's not the MOST volumizing or lengthening mascara ever, but it does a pretty good job. One thing I will say is because it's so waterproof you have to remove it with some cold cream (which is great for keeping your face young anyway) and let it sit on your lashes for at least 30 seconds and then gently massage the mascara off to avoid drying out and breaking lashes. I usually do this anyway to get my makeup off, but for those of you who don't, I highly recommend it. :)

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"This is a great solid liquid eyeliner.
I'm Asian & have a monolid so I have to draw my eye line fairly thick or it won't show; then there's also a problem with the amount of oil I tend to develop on my lid, so the liquid liner I use/choose, has to have some major staying power. I'm super picky with liners.
The Stila liquid eyeliner is amazing for what I want out of an eyeliner. As long as a eye primer is used, it doesn't crease or flake. Skip the primer & you'll notice it flake off. I tried Kat Von D's liquid eyeliner (which is a decent liner itself) & I'd pick the Stila formula over that one, cause it's more opaque than Kat's.
However, I'm giving the Stila liquid eyeliner a 4-star rating cause (has a lot to do with me being a tough rater), I prefer Kat's brush tip than the felt tip used for Stila. I feel that brush tips give me a finer handle on the lines.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I love this product. I'm usually hesitant when it comes to the waterproof mascaras, but the reviews sold me and they did not lie. Now, I haven't been swimming or anything yet, but what I do like is how it doesn't smudge under my eyes by the end of the day. I work 10 hour days most days and by the end of the day, my highly concealed under eyes are dark again because of my mascara. However, with cannonball, I'm not seeing so much of that anymore. The mascara is very defining, with subtle lift, but not any kind of major volume, which is why I start with the They're Real by Benefit and finish my coats with the Cannonball and they work out great together. It does have a lengthening quality to it,too. My eyelashes also don't feel dry, which is important. It's easy to remove with a make up removing cloth and it all comes off, no leftover residue.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"the classic Diorshow is my all time favorite mascara, but the waterproof version I do not recommend at all for the following reasons:

1. It is not going to give you the same effect that the regular non-waterproof Diorshow classic mascara gives you. The sephora associate told me this in store and I wish I had listened. Lashes are far from their most bold and beautiful with this mascara.
2. The tube dries out extremely quickly - in about 2 months of 4x week use for me. Product is still left - it's just dry.
3. I did comparisons with other waterproof mascaras, diorshow on this eye and the other brands on the other eye, and the diorshow was always the LEAST volumizing, LEAST black and LEAST lengthening.
4. The price. For something that is of this quality, you would expect it to be 6 bucks at the drug store

Love the classic non-waterproof version, but this one went into the trash and I will definitely never buy it again. Will try the MUF smokey eyes waterproof next as it was recommended to me in store and also by an online makeup artist guru I watch on youtube.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"If only this product had come out sooner...I'm in love with this all-nighter spray! I got a sample of this yesterday from a sephora rep and tested it out today. The rep told me to spray 3 times but a lot comes out in one spray so you need to spray about 1-2 times after you've completed your makeup application. Before using this I was always irritated when 1) my makeup would crack on the side edges of my mouth and 2) when my face makeup would oxidize throughout the day. For those of you who don't know what I mean by 'oxidize' it means that my face makeup would change color. I'm fair to light beige and my foundation matches my skin in the morning but by the end of the day it alters to a darker beige color. In turn, there was a huge color contrast between my face and neck. However, thanks to the all-nighter spray my makeup color stayed as is and no more cracks on the edges of my mouth!!! I had M@C's fix+ spray as a back-up but now that I've found this, I'm returning it tomorrow and going to purchase this.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I am a tough critic of eyeliner. It has to go on smoothly, be easy to clean up mistakes, and it has to have longevity.

I only used it as a daily wear at office and there is no hot weather or body exercise or humidity that will contribute to smudging. It is a complete joke branding it as ""WATERPROOF""!!! Also, it is neither volumizing nor lengthening, very hard to apply as you need to do it so carefully to avoid it touches your eyelid, and you need to do it repeatedly to at least see some effect. Unfortunately I cannot return it as the person gave it to me left the country. But I do hope my review can help other people from wasting their money on this.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I got a travel size of Trooper in an eyeliner set with my holiday Sephora order. This is the stand out from that set.
I am an eyeliner junkie. I will try every eyeliner I can get my hands on, but I am also a ... spazz when it comes to applying it. The pen tip on this makes it so much easier for me to not end up with thick, squiglie eyeliner lines. That makes me really happy.
The color is decently dark, without being stark, and it's pretty matte so you're not focusing on a strange textured eyeliner line. (UD's 24/7 liquid liner and your weird pearly finish, I'm looking at you here).
I've used this travel size almost everyday for seven months now. I'm starting to see some fraying on the brush tip, though I could have just put the cap on wrong (most likely case, to be honest). The tiny bit of fraying has not changed the application for me so far so I am not worried.
I keep expecting this to run out of liner since it's a travel size, but it just keeps going which gives me high hopes for when I put the full size in my next Sephora order.
The liner lasts all day really well, though I do always use it over a primer so I don't know how well it lasts on it's own. (I don't imagine it having issues though.)
Also, the lines this makes are nice and sharp. The only thing I have found that makes sharper lines is UD's 24/7 liquid liner which is my other go-to liner. This tattoo liner is really perfect for making the wings on cat eyes though. I love it.
I haven't tested if this is waterproof or not, I do have to continuously go over it with my makeup wipes to remove it so I would say that's likely.
This is not a smudgeable liner. (Which is good because who would want that in their liquid liner?)…read more",06 06 2013,5 stars,Lovely,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,8.00E+18
Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Mixed feelings on this product. Once you get it on, it is very long-wearing and smudge-resistant, though not waterproof. However, the applicator dip dries out very easily, and there's no way to force more product up into it, which can be frustrating. It tends to catch on my eyelid, making the line uneven, and sometimes sputters out in the middle of doing a cat eye, which is a real problem.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Having read all the reviews for this product, I was very excited to purchase and use this product. I bought their Naked Palette and their primer is genius, so how could they go wrong with mascara? Bound to be the answer to my lash-needs. Negative. I have very straight lashes. I need to curl them and then apply mascara, usually waterproof to ensure that the mascara won't give me ""raccoon eyes"" by the end of the day. I curled my lashes, applied the mascara and was happy with how they looked . . . for the first hour. Normally, waterproof mascaras hold curls better because of the formulation. By noon, the mascara was not holding the curl nor staying put. Please keep in mind I work indoors in an office that is kept at frigid temperatures in the summer, so it wasn't as if I were outside jumping in and out of a pool/ocean and playing volleyball, I was at work. Six hours after I had applied the mascara, it was clear that I had the ""raccoon eye effect"" going. It was embarrassing and it was so disheartening because I really thought this would be a great product. I am guessing if you have NATURALLY CURLY LASHES, this MAY be good, but if you have straight lashes, please save your money. DO NOT buy this product. It is not well formulated.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I really, REALLY wanted to love this. In the couple of years, my skin has gotten quite sensitive, and with that, quite dehydrated. I had heard so much about this primer, did my research, and was really looking forward to using it.
When I first tried it on, it felt great. It was cooling and hydrating, but applying my face makeup, I didn't see anything exceptionally different in the appearance of my face makeup. As the day went on, I still didn't really see much difference in appearance/longevity of my makeup.
As time went on with using this primer, I began to notice that my skin was getting bumps from irritation on my face. I thought because I had been trying new skin care, that that had been the reason. Between a lot of switching back and forth, and regulating my skincare, I realized that it might be this primer.
So, I stopped using this primer, waited for my skin to clear up, tried again, got the irritation, then stopped and tried again (because I desperately wanted this to work). But, unfortunately, it was he primer that caused me the allergic reactions strangely enough.
With all the probiotics included, and harmful ingredients left out, I think most people should not have the same reaction I had, but I thought I'd leave my experience here just in case.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I've been a fan of UD's primer potions for years, since I was a teenager and started experimenting with makeup.

I can spend five hours sweating in the summer sun at work and my makeup will not have budged. It definitely delivers on its promise to make eyeshadow colour more vibrant, and it leaves my skin feeling nice. However I just went out and bought a replacement since I'm out, and the new packaging's doe-foot applicator was broken when I took it out of the tube. It flops around like a sad marionette and I'm considering cutting it off to avoid getting it lost inside the bottle. I don't want to bother taking it back since I've read on a few blogs that it's a fairly common problem, and there's no guarantee the new bottle would be any different. Since the bottle squeezes I'm not as SOL as I would've been with the old genie bottle packaging, but it's still a disappointment, given how much it costs. Would've been better without the applicator at all, the squeeze bottle with a fine tip was much better. The formula, too, seems to be runnier than it used to be. It used to be like a spongy crème, and now it seems like a liquid, also a smaller volume of product for the same price than previous iterations.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Besides Tarte's Lights, Camera, Splashes! in black.

Here's some background information: I'm Asian, I have straight (but, pretty long) lashes, I use the Shu Uemura curler (who doesn't???), and have pretty oily skin.

I freaking love this mascara. Like I said before, it's one of two that I will only use. I've tried so many other mascaras and nothing compares to this and Tarte's. If I want my lashes to look almost baby doll like, I use Tarte's. If I want my lashes to look like feathers, I'll use this. This stays on my lashes for the most part. If I didn't have such oily skin, this would stay on until I took it off. Also, even with my very oily skin, not much comes off. I also dab some powder along my bottom lash line to keep my eyeliner in place, so that helps a lot too. A little trick I learned to do by myself. This literally does everything it's advertised to do. No joke. At least, on me it does. I've cried with this stuff on and none came off. It does, however, come off easily with eye makeup remover (I use Lancome's Bifacil...amazing!!!) which I appreciate.

Overall, one of my top favorites. I buy it all the time...sometimes two at a time. I'm obsessed.…read more",06 08 2011,5 stars,The only mascara I will ever use.,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,1.10E+18
Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I really like this mascara. If you're looking for a really thick, fake lash effect, this is NOT it! This mascara separates and lengthens. It is a very natural-looking effect, as if I was born with naturally long lashes. I gave it 4 stars because I would have liked the black to be a little blacker. It hasn't smudged on me, and the only time it left dark marks was one night when I was lazy with taking off my makeup.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I've been using DiorShow waterproof and DiorShow Black Out waterproof for years now, but I started to get fed up with how difficult it was to get off even with makeup remover, and the tendency to clump with a couple of coats or as the tube got older. I have to use waterproof mascara because my second job is as a gym owner and boxing trainer, and I sweat a lot. On the recommendation of a Sephora employee, I gave Cannonball a try, and I'm in love. It provides beautiful length and separation for a full fan of lashes with my usual two coats with no clumping. And key for me, it STAYS PUT through my entire full-time workday in an office and all night through very sweaty training at the gym. It never gives me raccoon eyes or flakes off, just stays looking perfect until I take it off. Incredibly easy to take off completely with remover, too. LOVE this one.

As other reviewers have said, Cannonball is almost totally waterproof. It gives me good length and decent volume (though sometimes I layer it over another mascara to amp up the volume a little), doesn't flake throughout the day, and layers pretty well. It's nice and black, and doesn't clump up too much even if I add another coat later in the day. It's a great daily mascara for me, and it's easy enough to remove with an oil cleanser. Love it!

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have monolids where my fold meets my lashline. This means my eyelids constantly have skin rubbing against skin and smudging is almost always inevitable. I've tried all the waterproof smudgeproof pencil and gel liners out there but none were successful in giving me a long lasting line through the entire day. Mac's gel eyeliner came close but would eventually start smudging.

This was the first liquid eyeliner I've ever tried but I don't see any reason to switch to another after trying it since it's PERFECT. It NEVER smudges. I recently wore it to a rock concert where I was dripping in sweat and constantly having hands and hair in my face. After the concert was over it was pouring rain outside and I got soaked. Once I returned home my eyeliner still looked PERFECT. I was amazed that the eyeliner could withstand all this and not smudge. It's seriously amazing. I also like the thin tip for a nice clean application since I usually go with a winged eyeliner look. If you have problems with smudging I definitely recommend this one!!!

note: I usually use Too Faced shadow insurance primer as well which helps with the smudging.",06 10 2012,5 stars,THE BEST,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-4.42E+18

The MJ lasted 12 hours plus with the waterline pretty much intact.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"During the summer I was going on a vacation to Mexico, and for me, I absolutely NEED mascara when I'm out and about, and I know the humidity and the water was going to be a huge issue for me. So, I tested my luck with the Urban Decay Cannonball and I must say I am IMPRESSED! I went swimming in both pools with chlorine, AND salty oceans, and when I looked in the mirror, it didn't even budge! It was intriguing. Even when I was tanning in the hot sun, it didn't even melt off my face like most ""waterproof"" mascaras do. This mascara holds true to length, but not so much to volume. I only ever really needed length,so the lack of volume didn't bother me much.. what more is there to ask for? This isn't a mascara that I'm going to buy every time, but in the summer, the Cannonball is a MUST ladies! Or when you're going vacationing to the tropics! (This picture is after I went swimming for hours in both pools and the ocean, and it didn't even smear or budge! All you need is a quick touch of mascara after and you're good all around!)

My long yet sparse and blond lashes looked full and dark but not clumpy and fake. I was already happy with my purchase when I went on a trip to Mexico. This mascara not only didn't run after getting in and out of the pool and tossed around in the ocean and diving off a platform into a sinkhole but it looked as awesome as if I had just applied it. I was in and out of the water all day every day and I never had to worry about my makeup running. Even better, my eyes look pretty and defined in all the photos. This stuff is just remarkable. If you need a truly waterproof mascara, this is for you. As for other mascara attributes, I think it simply defined my long lashes without thickening them much, which I like anyway.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,primer,"I used this for about a week but I unfortunately had to return it since it made me break out.

This stuff does work great. It's very moisturizing but unlike the korres primer, this one actually works as a primer.
It will help your foundation last longer and I loved that it didn't have silicone.

I had to return this though because it was creating small pimples all over my face. This foundation has lactobacilli which is a probiotic bacteria. But lactobacilli makes the environment around it acidic. I think that's why it made me break out. It was changing my skin's pH to acidic and my normal skin microbiota was not used to it. Each time I used this primer it got worse and worse. After a week I gave up and went to go return it because I was tired of the itchiness on my face.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Pros: I've never been good at handling liquid eyeliner, but this applicator tip made it easy. Held at a straight 90-degrees to the skin, it made a very precise line. I used it to draw a spiderweb design for a costume that turned out great on the first try. It dried fairly quickly (10-15 seconds), after which it didn't smudge at all, and it stayed on all night, even after sweating up a storm dancing (see the pic below). Afterward, it came off cleanly with a little cold cream, soap and water. No raccoon eyes in the morning!

Cons: It had a very matte finish after drying, to get it very black I had to go over parts twice, and it might have benefited from a third pass. Just not as shiny as some other liquid or cream eyeliners. Also, angling the tip doesn't give you an even, wide line as suggested, or maybe that's just my lack of skill showing.

Overall, I was very pleased with this product and its incredible staying power. I will definitely keep this around even as I get better with liquid eyeliner designs, as I think this will still be useful for more delicate details.",07 04 2013,5 stars,Great Beginner Eyeliner,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,4.41E+18

normally the felt tip pens are great at first but will start to dry up

ive only bought 2 of these ever and neither of them are on the dried out stage, and ive had them for quite a while.
the pens formula is absolutely fantastic, and the pen itself gives for a very accute and precise line. its dark and will last all day without any smudges or that horrible crease line you normally get after a while.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I bought the black waterproof mascara and I've used it for 6 months. I have Asian lashes that are medium in thickness and they grow straight down. Since my eyelashes don't curl with any mascara with out an eyelash curler, I wasn't expecting much from this one to perform that well. I don't care much for lengthening to be honest. I'm more so the kind of gal who is in love with big, thick, curly, voluminous lashes.

Waterproof Mascara in Black: The fragrance is a bit strong but my eyes aren't sensitive so I got use to the smell. The smell is pleasant just maybe too much for a mascara. The brush itself was amazing. The big dense brush definitely picked up all my lashes and in two coats I had beautiful natural eyelashes. Thickening was pretty good and the ability to hold a curl was FLIPPING amazing. Never in my life I've ever used a mascara that was able to curl my lashes without an eyelash curler. That alone sold me the product. Even though the price is kind of steep, I will definitely splurge on this product when I get the chance.

Final Remarks: When I don't feel like buying a department store mascara, a drugstore mascara that I always stand by is L'oreals mascara in Voluminous carbon black in waterproof. DiorShow mascara is basically that but 10X better. My only con for this product is that its hard to coat the bottom lashes without it touching the skin, other than that it's love.…read more",07 05 2012,5 stars,In love with this mascara.,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,4.14E+18

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,I have been using UD's original primer potion tube for years. I was happy when the original bottle with applicator was replaced with the squeeze tube. The tube kept the product fresher and kept it from drying out. I am so sorry to see the return to the applicator although with a tube versus the original bottle. The product still works well to set eyeshadow and to keep it from creasing. But the applicator is not hygienic and will waste product in the long run. This makes me sad because the product does work; I can just seeing needing to replace it more often now versus when it was in a tube. One has to wonder if that was the reason why the company made the decision to move away from the squeeze tube. I will be seeking out another primer when I finish with this one.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I have more normal than combination skin, with occasional dryness around my chin and mouth area, and throughout the day my skin gets a bit oily around my T-Zone.

I tried this for the first time a couple days ago when I was a bridesmaid for a wedding. I did all the bridesmaids' face makeup and topped everyone off with a couple sprays of this setting spray. Everyone's makeup stayed put all day long, and all the girls had their makeup done by 10:00AM. And in my culture, wedding's involve dancing from morning until night. I even sprayed the bride's face with it when she was done with her makeup and she looked flawless all day. She only needed to be touched up with some bronzer on her forehead toward the end of the night because the banquet hall was about 100 degrees and she had sweat it off.

Speaking of sweating it off...the ceremony was also really warm and I sweat pretty easily, as well. I was dabbing my forehead and upper lip with a napkin during the ceremony because I was quite literally sweating my butt off (TMI, I know) and when I looked at the napkin, there was NO makeup transferred to it at all. I'm not even exaggerating.

I especially like using this product in collaboration with my MUFE mist and fix spray which I like to spray on to make myself look less powdery and to intensify my highlight. The two products work really well together. I used it yesterday on its own, however, and it looked even more amazing and I did not touch up at all (I had another wedding to go to so I had a full face on again). It even made my highlight glow really nicely.

Usually I get creasing on my laugh lines but there was less creasing than ever when I got home after the second wedding. I didn't look powdery either. I'm really happy with this product.

The best part is it doesn't feel like hairspray for your face.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"WOW I don't even know where to begin. First off, this mascara is extremely waterproof. To give you an idea, it's very difficult for me to remove this mascara, even when using eye makeup remover that is specifically for waterproof mascara. I literally am on the search for a new eye makeup remover. This stuff is just too good. My experience with this mascara was a happy one. I went to the waterpark for hours. When I got back into my car, I checked in the mirror to see if this mascara held up. I couldn't believe it. It looked like I just put this mascara on. No smudges under my eyes or eyelids. It didn't come off at all. That was the moment I fell in love with this tube of magic. Lastly, just when you thought this mascara couldn't get any better.. It does. This mascara gives you length and volume. I wish I could wear it everyday in place of my other mascaras. It makes my eyes pop with the amount of length it gives my lashes. It's worth every penny ladies.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I had decided to use liquid liner since all of the pencil liners I've been using have only successfully made me look like a panda by the end of the day. Though many reviews complain about it's loss of color after long-time use, I haven't encountered that problem yet and it's been over half a year since I've started using it. As mentioned before, I was quite the beginner to use Liquid Liner but this particular product was not hard to pick up on at all. I have Asian eyes (though with a double-lid so I guess I can say I'm lucky), and the liner came on very smooth on my lids. I wore it for a whole day in humid weather, and even got my face wet, but it did not smudge at all.

I eventually caved and bought it for myself. So, my skin is normally pretty clear with the occasional rare pimple but when I started using this product I started breaking out BADLY. I had small bumps all over my forehead around my mouth tiny pimples along my cheeks and bigger ones along my hairline. I thought it must have been stress from college applications or senior year and kept trying to switch out other makeup products that I was using because it couldnt be my all natural coconut primer from Too faced!! I even rebought this product because it smelled good and felt so light on the skin. Ugh! Anyway just a month ago it was suggested to me that I must be breaking out because of my makeup so I went a week without wearing any skin makeup. Immediately my skin started to clear. I got excited and went back to using this primer with only a bit of concealer and started breaking out again. I finally accepted that this primer was causing the breakouts when I wore it only on my nose rather than in my entire face for another week and my nose broke out while the rest of my face cleared up.

I am in LOVE with UDPP!!! I tried another very well-known eyeshadow primer and it went very badly. The other well-known eyeshadow primer slid into my contacts throughout the day creating major burning sensations as well as blurring my vision. Do you know how pertinent it is for someone whose vision in both eyes is -5.75 to be able to see while driving through the long Los Angeles 7PM traffic to get back home?! Not to mention everything on my eyelid would smear and slide downwards.
UDPP IS A MIRACLE. No sliding into my eyes. No horrible nightmarish burning sensation in my eyes. No blurring of my vision. Very good for contact wearers (well for me at least). I CAN SEE. I've used even cheap $3 eyeshadows on top of UDPP and it holds up long enough to make it from 5AM to late lunch.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Jen from frmheadtotoe actually introduced me to this mascara through one of her videos and I have to say, it really changed my life. My Asian lashes grow straight down and are thin and pathetic. Most mascaras make them droop or smudge onto my (oily) eyelids by the end of the day. This mascara lengthened my lashes and held the curl until I removed it. It stays on remarkably well even in humid weather. It's very easy to remove with waterproof makeup remover or (what I prefer using) thefaceshop's rice water cleansing light oil. Seriously this mascara is one of the best for Asians!! Definitely HG mascara!

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Let me start my saying I have stick-straight, short asian eyelashes. I use a Shu Uemura eyelash curler and this stuff, and I love how my lashes look when I use them. They look full and long and dark, but not false. Very buildable though - if you apply multiple thin layers, you can build it to your liking. I used to use a primer and mascara to make my lashes look longer. I don't need a primer anymore now that I use this. I prefer the waterproof to the regular DiorShow largely because the waterproof helps my eyelashes hold a curl. My eyelashes always fall flat and start sticking straight out with regular mascara. This dries out gradually as does any mascara (maybe a little more so, in part because it's waterproof?) but I use my tubes for six months or so. This last tube I used to the point it was so dry that the brush is matting, and I can still apply it and have great looking lashes, it just takes a bit longer and creates some fallout. Another thing I've noticed with this mascara - It leaves my eyelashes soft and flexible, even after I've taken my makeup off. I found a drugstore mascara that performs comparably overall, but left my eyelashes feeling sticky and stiff during use and brittle and dry after washing it away.…read more",07 09 2011,5 stars,Love it,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-6.35E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"Let me first preface by stating that I have extremely sensitive, allergy-prone, and watery eyes. For years, I have searched for a very pigmented black liner for my water line and inner corners, where I have the most trouble keeping my eyeliner on. I think I may have found the best eyeliner for me.

I got this item as a 100 point perk to try out the new Marc Jacobs line and was immediately pleased with the pitch black consistency when I swatched the liner on my hand. In the shower, an hour or so later, I had to give the swatch a good scrub to remove, which got me really excited to give this liner a real go the next morning.

I have used this several times since and overall, I am very pleased. As watery as my eyes are, this liner stays on longer than any I have tried before it on my lower lash line and I use this in my inner ""v"" to re-enforce my top liner. This liner will not create raccoon eye and a little will go a long, long way due to it's wonderfully smooth and impossibly dark color.

Bottom line, I very much plan on purchasing this item when I run out and highly recommend those with watery eyes to give it a shot.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I recently just finished my bottle of all nighter, which I bought in late November 2012 (before Urban Decay revamped all their setting spray packages in December 2012). I assumed that only the packaging had changed and not the formula, so I bought the new all nighter. I immediately started to break out with the new all nighter - I know bc it was the only thing that changed with my beauty routine. Just to be sure I researched online and sure enough I found out that that the formula had been 'tweaked'. I'm disappointed because I really was a huge fan of this product. This new formula might still work for girls with less acne prone/sensitive skin. I submitted a similar review of this product a week ago...strange that it wasn't posted.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've been using this eyeliner now for probably close to 2 years. Maybe longer. I am so madly in love with this product. I suffer from dry eye, and while no make-up will ever beat the battle of the tears, Kat Von D's eyeliner comes close. There is so much to love about this eyeliner. #1. The formula is well made. The liner stays on my eyes until I take it off and it comes off easily with make-up remover or cleansing oil. #2. The brush tip. I used to use Stila's eyeliner pen but constantly found the felt tip to be a massive drawback. The brush tip on Kat's eyeliner is perfection. It is made of tons of small hairs that never...and I mean never...get misshapen or dull. This is a godsend for those like me who rock cat eyes on a daily basis. #3. The product last FOREVER. I typically have each pen for 6 months or more and that's with daily use. Strong pigmentation and a serious bang for your buck. I've honestly never bought a product that was such an amazing return on investment. The price almost seems too low for how much product you actually get and with how well made the material attributes of the tube are. #4. Dries quickly. Unlike liquid eyeliner, you don't have to wait to open your eye for fear of smearing the liner into your crease. This stuff is like superglue. Set it and forget it...wait...that's the rotisserie machine... Anyways, as I was saying, this stuff dries quickly making it easier to finish up your make-up without fear of smudging. If you do make a mistake, it's easy to clean up with some make-up remover and a Q-Tip (I recommend Make Up Forever's sensitive eye remover. It's blue and so kind to your eyes. God bless it.)

Oh yeah, and it's waterproof. Like, legitimately waterproof. I have gone swimming and sweated and it hasn't budged.

I know this was long winded but I really wanted to prove to you how quality this product is. I wouldn't write such a long review if I didn't have so much love for this product.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I wanted a brightening gel liner that could be used for the lower rim. My Sephora only carries On the Buff so I went ahead and tried it. It's a very subdued champagne color and has micro sparkles that is very flattering, but you can only tell it's on in certain lighting. That's my beef with this product.
I also went ahead and tried the Lancome Liqui-liners which are very similar, and Lumiere and Lume are wayyyy to bright. They look extremely unnatural under the eyes whereas the Marc Jacobs one is ery subdued. But I'd take natural over over-the-top any day. The Lancome ones also bother my eyes a bit, whereas the Marc Jacobs one doesn't bother me at all. 
I think the shimmery eyeliners are fine for under the eyes. I received the black liner as a birthday gift and I don't like it at all, because you can't sharpen it and big black lines look crazy on my eyelids.

But for all the girls out there who love waterproof, and have limpy, non-curling lame lashes, this is your life saver. From the reviews I read, I didn't think this was going to help much with volume and length, but I was wrong. 1. It'll lift and curl and hold 2. it'll separate and volumize lashes 3. it'll stay on without flaking 4. my lashes are surprisingly still very soft, not hard and flaky! 5. I love the small brush that gets all of your eyelashes and really lift and define. If there is an under rated product out there, this is it. Try it now!!!!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,After using this a few times and being so disappointed I am finally leaving a review.

It gets so dried out I can't finish my makeup in the morning! I don't use much eyeliner and I don't wear it everyday and I haven't had this that long. It does last all day though if you can manage to get it on. It also does that horrible thing where it will pull off the eyeliner already applied when you're doing another coat or extending.

When I say completely, I mean completely. I tried standing it up for a few days without opening it.. shaking it up.. everything, but no go. At $19 I won't be purchasing it again, that's just too much (for me) to justify having to replace it every 2 months - there are so many cheaper alternatives I've loved in the past, some as low as $2 that lasted much longer.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"This is the only mascara that makes it through a day of swimming. I literally almost drowned while wearing this, and it didn't budge - it's that hardcore. That said, it is really hard to remove. You HAVE to use something oil-based to take it off. As far as how it looks - it is beautiful. I have long lashes naturally, and this thickens, lengthens, and most of all CURLS. It curls my lashes like nothing ever has - not even a lash curler. Pretty amazing. It's also a very deep black, and doesn't even feel like you're wearing mascara. It's very lightweight. LOVE.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I first purchased the ""travel size"" bottle of All Nighter directly from UD when they had it for 40% off a few months ago (probably to sell off ""old stock"" just prior to launching the new packaging). I liked it so much, that I've since purchased two more full-size bottles while on sale for $18. The sale price was a big incentive, as was the opportunity to get it in the old packaging; reviewers have complained that the product now has a bad smell (from the new packaging???).

I really wasn't expecting much from the All Nighter spray, but with so many positive reviews, I figured it might just work. It exceeded my expectations! My makeup looked so much fresher, and for so much longer after using it.  I knew to spray it BEFORE applying my mascara (reviews, included instructions), forgot to shake the bottle the first few times I used it, but it still helped keep my makeup looking good (but it works even better after shaking before use!). 

*One side note: since I started using All Nighter, I've also been using NARS mattifying primer just on my nose or sometimes my entire t-zone as well (still using my old NARS Radiance primer on the rest of my face), and the combination of these two products has greatly improved the staying power of my fave NARS Tinted Moisturizer on and around my nose.

In my experience, most American brands that claim that they are waterproof will still smudge on me and give me dark rings. This stuff does not budge. Although I agree that it can be a bit clumpy, this is easily solved by wiping some product on the rim before application. This stuff holds a curl and makes my lashes look awesome.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"This product is great and does the things it claims to do. I swam in a pool for hours in 108F heat and it didn't budge. I didn't get volumizing results, but it did lengthen very well. Although I liked the results of this mascara, it is close to impossible to remove. I used two different types of makeup remover and wipes, a washcloth, and pulled out a few eyelashes trying to remove it. Once it came off, it looked like I had a black-eye under my bottom lashes that I couldn't get off. This product is not worth the work to me.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I have to agree with many of other reviews here---the product has changed, for the worse. I had searched for years to find a primer that would keep my liquid liner in place. I have oily lids and was often in climates not good for eye makeup, such as high humidity or freezing cold (b/c your eyes tear and makeup smears). Finding this primer was a revelation---it kept my liquid liner (for reference, Kat Von D tattoo liner) in place through tears and in-climate weather and even swimming. I can say that these two products were some of the only makeup products I've encountered that NEVER let me down. Completely reliable.

But now! :( The Urban Decay primer is still okay---works well enough about 70% of the time. But when I'm at a party and someone has to tell me I have some creased eye makeup (after only wearing it for a few hours)... not acceptable.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have super straight asian lashes that collapse with 95% of mascaras. The only 2 that have ever held my curls and made my lashes long and pretty were discontinued so I have been on the hunt forever. I have found a couple that barely held the curl but made it look like I wasn't wearing any mascara at all. This mascara not only held the curl, the length was ridiculous! Now that I have found this I will never buy another! I highly recommend this for all asian girls.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I think this is the first mascara, besides they're real, that I've purchased twice in a row. I used to get eyelash extensions because I hate the inevitable, dark cast that mascara leaves under my eyes not only at the end of the day but even within an hour of wearing it. I gave up eyelash extensions and had to find a mascara that would let me go through a full day of work and not make me look tired/worn. They're real just didn't cut it so I tried this waterproof one in UD and love it! I can even apply it to my bottom lashes and not worry about smudging. I also like how it lengthens my lashes and does Not clump. It's also fairly easy to remove with an oil cleanser. My only regret is that most Sephora stores are not carrying this in store anymore.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"This was the first ever setting spray that I purchased! I bought this because I had a huge Vegas trip and am notorious for being sweaty! Usually when I go out with my girls, after a night full of dancing, I'm soaked and I get major raccoon eyes. So attractive, right?! Not. At first, I was skeptical. How can a spray really make your make-up last all day? Ladies, it does! And trust me, I put it to the test! I'd also like to add that I did have Urban Decay's All-Nighter foundation on so it might've been a magical combination of the two but I stayed flawless the whole trip! It was about 100 degrees out and we were at Encore Beach Club (day club) so I was definitely sweating my little behind off! I was so surprised when we came back to our hotel room hours later and everything was still in place! I didn't even need to do any touch up's before we left to go to dinner then the night club. We left around 11am and came back around 3am.. Everything was in place! A bit of under eye smearing from my eyeliner and my lip color wore off a bit, but still, it was truly a religious experience.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Let me begin by saying - the previous bad reviews may have been defective? Because I've been doing cat eyes forever as they are my ""signature"" - I had LONGED for a product that was waterproof, smudge resistant, and buildable (as I do touch-ups to sharpen out my lines and match lines on both sides) - THIS IS THE ONE. When I swatched the product on my hand in store, I had to scrub it off - so I knew then that it was water resistant. But when it took me shorter than its ever taken me to draw a cat eye because of it's precision and ease of application, right then I knew this was my new baby. I need something I can apply heavy for a dramatic look, and thinner for a simplistic look. This is it. I swear, I'll porbably throw away the other liners I have tried and gave up on!

The verdict: AWFUL. Completely awful. My makeup went on very patchy and looked really dry which was unusual. Once I was finished putting on my makeup entirely (which took a little more effort than usual) it didn't look too bad. But after only a few hours, my makeup looked just awful. It was patchy and dry and looked like it was 3 days old. My other primer keeps my foundation looking flawless even overnight through to the next day! This stuff just didn't hold up. I'm not sure how this is rated so high honestly as it is the worst primer I've ever tried.

A few other colors from 2014's Christmas set were way too glittery for me, but maybe okay for other users.

My rub is with the misleading packaging. You go to the shop and look at the display, and the single pencils are in long tubes. The value sets are in little shorter tubes. But when I look online at the amount of product, 0.01 oz, I realize it's the same amount of product as I get in the three minis set. And I just checked the old tubes I had from the Christmas set, and they are also 0.01 oz. So the packaging size changes, but the amount of product is the same in the small tubes as in the big tubes.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I use airbrush makeup, which is water based and can make your skin look a little dry. By using Urban Decay All Nighter to set my makeup, my skin looks amazing. I also use a primer for my skin and one for my eyeshadow, which probably helps too. I spray a little All Nighter on after using primer, let it dry and then airbrush on my makeup. After I've finished with my eyes, brows, cheeks and everything else - but before mascara - I spray it fairly liberally all over my face. Once it has dried, I apply my mascara. I suppose with a waterproof mascara, it probably wouldn't cause it to run, but it is too much work to clean up that mess and touch everything back up, so I've never tried it. I have skin that can get shiny pretty quickly and that never happens when I use this setting spray. My makeup lasts all day and stays looking fresh.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Love this stuff and has been a permanent fixture in my makeup bag for years. Very long wearing. I work 12 hour shifts, have very straight lashes, and have VERY oily eyelids which could be a recipe for disaster when it comes to lashes. Athough some of the fibers flake off and a little smudging is present at the end of my 12 hours it's a small price to pay. Most people who don't have oily lids will likely find smudging not a problem at all anyway. It's best to really make sure to remove all the excess product before applying as it tends to get clumpy when you apply too much, thus weighing down your lashes and cutting the life of your curl short. So apply thin layers using a light hand. I find this really makes my lashes look most natural and adds to the longevity of my curl. I've tried maaaany mascaras over the years and very few compare.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I bought these in Blacquer and In the Buff. I bought Blacquer for the express purpose of tightlining my upper waterline because I had heard over and over again that it doesn't transfer. Well, it sure does transfer to my lower waterline. :( I bought In the Buff to brighten my lower waterline but on my fair skintone it doesn't really show, so that's not really the fault of the liner! It really is a pretty color. But if I could go back in time I'd take the $50 I spent on these liners and use them on a MJ shadow palette.

Anyway, the texture is fairly soft. You can smudge these. The black feels more workable for smokey/smudgey than the champagne color to me.

I am already onto my second bottle, having my first one being the older packaging XL version. I have to admit the first few times I just thought this spray was not working at all but that was just because I was literally using this as the final step to my make up routine. Because of that my face got super oily, a big no-no. However now I use this after finishing my eye makeup and foundation but before I use a loose power/bronzer/blush. By doing this, this product works AMAZING.

My biggest complaint was that it left my skin looking shinny after 4 hours. However, I do use a tinted moisturizer (I didn't have the shine problem before) so maybe it'll be fine if you use a matte foundation. Also, I found that it takes a while to fully absorb. It has the consistency of a lotion, not like the super light-weight primers (e.g. Hourglass).

The girl at the counter turned me on to it, because I probably would have passed on it. But I gave it a try and really loved it. I just bought too more because I finally ran out of the first one.

I tried Stila, Lorac, Smashbox and would have to pick this one as my absolute favorite. It's really well made. I hated the felt tip of Stila's liner, and Lorac was super runny. Smashbox was a little better, but it was too dry for me. The fact that this liner has a very fine brush is awesome!!! The flow is very even and every angle of the brush has the same saturation.

cons: hard to get off. if you mess up and try to fix it, unless you fix it immediately, it will smudge.
I mess up my eyeliner a lot so having one that sets right away can be an issue for me. I just have cotton swabs nearby and it's usually okay. but there have been a few days where I had to make it look like I was attempting a smokey eye when I really wasn't.
Other than that, it's a great eyeliner. but if you have a really unsteady hand, I wouldn't try it.",09 12 2013,4 stars,really does stay on all day!,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-5.54E+18
Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Let me just preface this by saying I have super short, sparse, and Asian eyelashes. This mascara is AMAZING for length, and holds a curl all day. However, it does smudge a bit for me since I have oily eyelids, and if I don't try very hard to wipe off most of the product for the first coat, my lashes can become clumpy and spidery, and I have to use a comb to brush through. All in all I recommend highly!! But please ladies wipe the excess off before applying and you will have amazing fluttery lashes.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I love this liner. I now have it in Black, Dark Brown, Midnight, and Moss. The tip is perfect. It is easy to apply. My eyes look so amazing with this. Because of the nature of the tip, it is possible to make subtle differences in how your liner is applied, very easily. For example, I've made a lovely cat-eye sweep one day, and the next made a high-in-the-centre rounded style look, kind of like a cute goat. Haha. No really, I swear by this liner. I am gradually acquiring it in all the colors. I can't wait to try white. Oh yes - and I found that it lasts all day which is 12 hours for me.

It's so easy to apply. I can do my wing liner in a minute. It's very black which I love. And the staying power is unbelievable. I used to have to reapply a few times during the day but not with this. I go to conventions where I wear makeup for 9+ hours and even my eyeshadow and foundation start to crease but never my eyeliner.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I'm in love with this liner - not sure I'll ever use anything else.
I have to use an eye lubricant every nite for severe dry eye issues. Even though I wash my face AND eyelids in the morning, my eye liner always transfers after a couple of hours b/c of the eye treatment. So, I had to pretty much give up on eye liner or not use my eye lube the nite before if I wanted my eye liner to stay put.
BUT, the I found the KVD tattoo liner (in Trooper). I was at Sephora doing Xmas shopping, and bought it on a whim b/c I heard the hype and it's waterproof. And, OMG, this liner isn't going anywhere. I can wear it all day with no transfer...finally, something that works for my oily lids!!
Pros: this baby isn't moving, waterproof, doesn't crack or fade, thin tip for perfect wing, true black
Cons: if you want a thick line, you'll have to work it a little, there's a learning curve on how to apply for the product to glide properly (glide it on at an angle) and...it's expensive (but to me, worth every flipping penny).

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"The cat-eye is my trademark.
That being said, my liquid liner has to be perfect. Sadly I'm still on the hunt for an eyeliner that is BOTH waterproof and easy to apply.
This eyeliner is waterproof in all shape and form. It isn't rub proof though-just be aware. It has lasted me 12-18 hour days.
I spent 20 minutes in Sephora trying to pick the BEST waterproof eyeliner.
I got this one. First few applications were great! It's been 2 weeks now and the liquid doesn't flow making it so hard to flick out that I have to restart 2-3 times. Waste of time in the morning rush. I can't tell if the felt dried out already or if it just doesn't apply well over eyeshadow or both.

It did not blend well with Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer at all. I use tinted moisturizer because it is light and this product also so heavy.

It left my skin feeling sticky all day and did nothing for the appearance of my pores whatsoever.

I am returning it tomorrow.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Ok so I've come to terms with the fact that NO liquid eyeliner is completely waterproof, not this or Kay von d or Marc jacobs or any of them. But I love the liquid eyeliner look so I do this trick. I love the Stila liquid eyeliner so I do my eyes with that first - after primer and eyeshadow- and let it dry. Then I sharpen my tarte sex kitten eyeliner to a nice point and go overtop the stila liner very carefully. THIS combo is actually waterproof-my eyes constantly water especially in cold weather and this stays put. This way I get the look of liquid with the waterproof-ness of the crayon.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I have skin that is oily but dehydrated on the surface. I cannot use any ""cone"" based primer as they cause me to have cystic acne.
I find this works very well in my constantly changing climate (typically humid but where I work is very drying to my skin).
One and a half pumps works for me and this is fast absorbing, I prefer to apply my liquid makeup when the primer is still damp. It does have a bit of stickiness to it, but that is what makes it work as a non-cone primer.
I tried a liquid mineral based primer and found that it looked great at home, but at work my skin would become dry and my makeup looked cakey despite a light application of CC cream or sheer to medium build foundation.
When I began to use this, the dryness and cake-ness stopped, so it's working well in hydrating my skin.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I had heard that this mascara was THE mascara from multiple magazines and so when it was time to get a new mascara I decided to try it.

It really is spectacular; it lengthens, volumizes, curls and separates significantly. It doesn't clump and it stays put - you will definitely need a waterproof makeup remover because regular makeup remover will not work. I cannot apply mascara without getting it all over my eyelids, but this formula rubs right off my skin without leaving black streaks, no makeup remover required.

Be aware that it will look a little shiny when wet but it mattes as it dries so your lashes actually look pretty natural, aside from being dramatically longer and thicker.

PS - If you really want your mascara - any mascara - to go on super easily and smoothly, warm it up while you are doing your hair and the rest of your makeup by putting it in your bra next to your skin, or slip it between the waistband of your pants and your skin. Warming the mascara this way makes it glide on much more easily.…read more",10 06 2009,5 stars,WOW!,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,3.14E+18

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"Used this for an outdoor/indoor wedding on myself, the bride and a couple of other bridesmaids. I sprayed the front and sides of the face for each girl. Other than lipgloss (which was expected) we didn't have to touch up even after 12 hours! By the time it was time to take it off, my makeup still looked beautiful.

The bride and I have dry skin and another bm who used this has combo/oily skin and it does seem to work for all our skin types. If you have really dry or really oily skin, the UD website has 2 other kinds of setting sprays you can choose from but I chose this one for our bridal party.

Granted, it wasn't too hot or too humid or rainy outside so I have no idea how this works against the elements. Also, all us girls miraculously were able to hold in our tears (I suppose we were just too harried and busy to cry) so I also am not sure how this spray would hold up to that. But I know that using this definitely can't hurt--after all, I have never gone 12 hours without touching my makeup before--until I used this.",10 08 2010,5 stars,All nighter AND All-day!,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,2.29E+18

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have tried almost ever type of mascara available at sephora, other beauty stores/counters, and drugstores. I love the original Diorshow mascara but was noticing that even with my dry skin it was smudging a lot so I decided to give the waterproof a try, boy am I glad I did!!! There has only been one other mascara that I loved in waterproof more than the non, but it still doesn't compare to this! I've got almost all of my friends (ranging from 24-50+) hooked on these mascaras, this just happens to be my personal favorite. I naturally have full, long lashes but they are light in color- this makes it look like I'm wearing false lashes, and not in a bad over the top way. I can't tell you how many compliments I receive wearing it! If you don't like the regular, give the waterproof a try, and vice versa :)

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"Stopped at my local Sephora yesterday for some hair products and noticed a buzzing hive of sales gals in front of the Marc Jacobs Beauty line so I just had to ask...what's the big deal?! Each gal had several favorite products, but all agreed: the Highliner, Lash Lifter mascara and lip products were seriously to die for. They all said they were unlike any other products - from color saturation and wear to high quality packaging with unique features. I decided to try the Highliner, as I'm always looking for a violet liner to bring out the green in my hazel eyes. Jazz (berry) did just that. It went on smooth and silky. It was super easy to control the amount of liner applied and the thickness of the line plus I had plenty of time to smudge/blend the line before it dried. These qualities are very important to me, as I'm usually just awful at applying liner - pencil, gel or liquid, under my incapable hands often leave me looking clownish. I'm blown away by how easily this liner was to apply. Plus, it lasted all day (and all night, as I forgot to remove it at bedtime!).",10 08 2013,5 stars,Another Win for Marc Jacobs Beauty,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-7.90E+18

Another thing I noticed was that my skin was noticeably brighter and fresher-looking. The best thing about this product? My skin even looked bright and fresh the next morning!

Final impression: For the price and the name I was expecting an amazing eyeliner. This is now my back up last resort liner because I don't want to throw it out. Mine started drying out after second use. I keep the cap on tightly so no reason for it to. it's patchy, crumbles, clumps my lashes, makes my eyes water with and without contacts which I've never had an issue with before.

It is extremely watery and sheer! And takes forever to dry. It's so sheer that it's laughable as an eyeliner to do a cat eye (my go to every day look). The photo on here with the silver grey is of the old tube, which says made in Japan packaged in Korea. The new tube is gold and only says made it Korea. I literally wear this eyeliner every day and it lasts so well that if I forget to wash it off it is still intact and flawless in the morning! The new tube- no way. Smudged and transfered immediately.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I purchased this product after trying on a few different liners at Sephora. Previously, I used Victoria's Secret liquid liner pens...but those are near impossible to find (and possibly discontinued).

Kat Von D's Tattoo liner is affordable compared to most other brands at Sephora, and importantly, the liner is:

1) Very easy to control (shaky-hand safe!). I drew precise, delicate lines with barely any effort. I easily built up to thicker lines when I felt like it.

2) Fast-drying: Though it's good to wait a couple seconds before blinking.

3) Long-lasting: Hours later, my eyeliner was right where it started...and it looked great!

I'm very happy with this liner and will buy more when it runs out :)",10 12 2009,5 stars,"Amazing, easy-to-use liquid liner",https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,8.75E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Over the last 15 years, I have owned many eyeliners. To be honest, none compare to this one. I initially bought this one in the color ""trooper"" (simple black) at Sephora. My usual method of shopping for eyeliners is as follows: I walk throughout the store for 1/2 hour, during which time I draw on my hand with the prospective liners. I give them at least 1-2 minutes to set. Then I try the following:
1. Smudge test: Results-->did not even budge.
2. Saliva test: you can guess how this works. Results-->color remains bright, no smudging after 3 minutes.
3. Time test: I try to wipe the eyeliner off my hand after 20 minutes of hard-core shopping for other cosmetics. Results-->still strong. If anything, stronger: stays on the skin throughout vigorous smudging attempts, as well as digestive enzyme applications (you guessed it, the saliva test repeated once again).
4. Makeup remover test: this is what convinced me to buy this one. Results-->stays put for 4-5 serious wipes with the makeup remover, then eventually comes off. After wearing this eyeliner for the last several months, I have discovered that it easily lasts throughout the day (even throughout the length of my workday, which is basically 7AM - 6PM). I withstands my eyes tearing up, hot weather (hot Texas summers) and humidity.

Sidenote: This eyeliner is for those who want precision. It has a very fine tip, which allows for superior precision with regard to drawing extremely fine lines (something I absolutely love, but which is not for everyone).

While I strongly value the worth of an eyeliner based on its ability to last throughout the day, this eyeliner not only delivers in function, but also in fun. Using this Kat von D eyeliner, it is possible to create an endless array of looks, ranging from the everyday (the one you put on in the morning without thinking) to the dramatic (the one you want to show off in the club). So rest assured, while you are experimenting with your look, your creation will stay put throughout the night...as well as the next morning.…read more",10 12 2010,5 stars,Perfect Eyeliner for Perfectionists,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,1.31E+18

For $20, I contemplated for a minute but he reminded me that I could return it if I was not happy. SOOOO GLAD I BOUGHT IT! Definitely worth the money. I purchased it over 2 months ago, and it still works like new! The liquid comes out just as bright and strong as the first use. Definitely found my new Liquid Eye Liner!

However, unfortunately, I hated it. It left a ""whitish"" caste on my NC44 skin, which I was unable to cover up with eyeshadow entirely. For example, it made my warm toned bronze and brown eyeshadow come off appearing more cool-toned. Furthermore, I found my eyeshadow creasing within 8 hours.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have a love-hate relationship for this liner. Sometimes I'll get one from Sephora that will be perfect and last forever, other times I've purchased and received a liner that is already dried out then have to go back to exchange. I'm unsure if it has to do with how it's stored. I've found that storing tip down (like artist brush pens) helps keep the felt tip pen supple with liquid. Once you finally get this to work properly and dispense enough liquid, it works wonders.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have the absolute hardest time putting liquid eyeliner on, I have bought and returned them over and over because I simply can't get a straight line and make it look good...until now. I was shocked at just how easy this is to put on, and even with my shaky hands and naturally curly eyelashes that always get in the way of the pencil of all other eyeliners I have tried - this one went on with a nice even, dark, perfectly straight line.

The difference I found with this one, compared to all other liquid eyeliners, is that the colour comes out from the tip in even saturation, so I can literally use the tip (which is very small and sturdy - doesn't bend when gliding along the eye) to draw the line all the way across in one go rather than having to dot it and try to join it up - which never comes out straight for me. Other liners do not have the colour come out as evenly just from the tip as this one does - so either you dot and join the line, or lay it flat and try to draw across, which never works for me because my eyelashes get in the way and the pencil bumps around making an uneven line that I have to try to fill in with eye shadow.

I had almost given up and thought I would never be able to use liquid eyeliner and get that nice sharp line I always coveted on other ladies...but eureka, with this, I finally can.

And it stays on, all day. No crumbly fall out or smudges. It was actually a bit hard to get off at night, but I just used a bit of moisturiser and it wiped off cleanly.

I have it in Alloy, and will be picking it up in other colours as well.",11 01 2016,5 stars,Love !! Easy application,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,7.36E+18

It darkens, lengthens and gives my stubby lashes a bit of extra volume. This brush works great if you have Asian lashes like mine. The only thing I've noticed about the mascara is that the fibers will flake off and land on my cheeks throughout the day. To be fair, this happened some time after my purchase. I imagine the mascara must be drying out. The fall out is minimal though, so I'm not too upset about this.

These liners really do stay a good 14-16 hours (keep in mind I do use UD Primer Potion every day because I have oily lids so that may help) Love the fact that I can control the thickness or thinness of the line with these liners! Absolutely NO flaking or smudging after a 14 hour workday & workouts. LOVE these! My new favorite liner...these might just take the place of my favorite MUFE liquid Aqualiners. You can smudge these, just do quickly before it dries. But these don't budge once they are dry so keep that in mind.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I was so impressed with this mascara. I am so used to either having them not actually BE waterproof, or looking like there's no difference to your lashes at all. However, this one seriously makes your lashes look nice, dark, thick, and long, but will ACTUALLY stay on through exercise, humid days, and even jumping into the pool! I have repurchased twice already. It's awesome. Not the most intense mascara ever, but will make your lashes look naturally gorgeous. Sometimes if I want a really dramatic look for going out or something I layer it over my other fave mascara (Lancome's Hypnose Drama) to increase it's staying power and liklihood of smudging, which works pretty well!! For people that are complaining about it being clumpy - clean your brush off! And for people that have flaking into their eyes, I have only had this happen when I have layered more mascara on after it had fully dried. If I continue to build it up while it is still a little wet this doesn't seem to happen for me. Also, if you do fully jump in the pool I would NOT recommend like rubbing your eyes a lot... that will definitely lead to some smudging/clumping. But it will definitely not melt off from the water alone!!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I absolutely LOVE this product. The tip is extremely precise and if you make a small mistake it's not so permanent that you cant wipe it up with a wet q tip. 

What I'm realizing is many girls are finding that it dries out. That's true, after a week or two it won't be as bold as the first time you use it.

**TIP: what you need to do, and I think Kat Von D even suggested this, you need to wet the tip of the liner again. I usually let my faucet run just enough for small drops, and I let one of two drops of water hit the eyeliner tip. Then I brush one or two strokes on top of my hand and it's just as bold. 

Try it and it will work fine for you :D

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"So sad, I've used urban decay primer potion for years and have recommended it to everyone, but they have changed the formula and packaging. Now I'm lucky if I get an hour or two without creasing eyeshadow. It stays slick instead of drying fast, and the applicator is so unhygienic! It was much better when you could just squeeze out how much you needed and just apply with your fingers instead of using the applicator and then shoving it back in to the bottle (germs included!)

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"This is by far the best eyeliner I've ever seen! I went into a Sephora store to pick up my birthday gift last month and I wanted to check out the Marc Jacobs products in person to make sure that was what I wanted. I went over to the display and did a little swatch of the eyeliner on my hand and I glided right on like butter! It was such a soft texture. But don't let that fool you! Soft DOES NOT mean it moves around. Of course when you go into Sephora you come out with tons of swatches on your hands. Of all the lip products I had swatched (most of which were supposed to be products with no transfer), the only thing on my hand that didn't budge was this eyeliner. I literally had to scrub at my hand with my finger to see even the slightest bit of transfer or movement. And it didn't even smudge around on my hand, only a little bit came off on my finger. When I finally got a chance to try it on my eyes, it went on really smooth and it felt great! I was able to accidentally smudge it when I was applying, but that's only because I get pretty oily in those areas. After it ""settled"", it stayed on all day long with absolutely no problems. This eyeliner survived my oily t-zone areas in addition to scorching and humid 100 degree Georgia heat (which of course led to a little more oil on my face). It's such a great product! I'd recommend it to anyone, and I'm definitely buying to full size when my sample runs out.",11 07 2016,5 stars,BEST EYELINER EVER!!!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,3.33E+18

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I picked this up yesterday, after being loyal to the Marc Jacobs Magic Marc'er for the last two years. I thought to myself it's insane to keep spending $30 on eyeliner, when I've heard so many good things about this one. The thing I really like about this liner is the brush tip. It goes on so well! I'm an artist and love brush tip pens. I wish they'd put this exact tip on art markers.  Application was so easy! Perfect symmetrical cat eyes on the first try. So that's a huge bonus. The thing I didn't like about this product was surprisingly the pigmentation. Maybe I've just been spoiled by Marc, but I got used to how BLACK that liner is, and after using that for so long, I was really disappointed I couldn't get this liner as dark. I'll probably keep this liner around as a back up, or maybe for casual day use, but I'm definitely going back to Marc after this.…read more",11 08 2016,4 stars,love the brush tip,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-2.85E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I chose this pencil in Blacquer as a 100 point perk - I'm glad I didn't spend $30 on it. It is intensely pigmented and very long-wearing. However, these qualities present problems. This liner is not forgiving to beginners or those of us who don't have perfect technique. There is an extremely short window of time to erase mistakes, and there is usually a smudgy mess where you tried to erase. Once it's on, it's not coming off unless you want to scrub with eye makeup remover. It is also a very thick lead, making it almost impossible to get a thin line from it. I felt like I looked like Avril Lavigne - that's how thick this stuff goes on. Overall, I guess this is a good crayon for experts who like the Marc Jacobs line. I will be sticking to kohl pencils and pots of gel liner.",11 09 2013,2 stars,"Difficult to use, very unforgiving of mistakes",https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-3.79E+17

In addition, it separates and defines my lashes very well, almost as much as a defining mascara, and it's a little lengthening, too. If I've already curled my lashes, it holds the curl (although it's not curling on its own.)

I always brush it through and seperate everything with a clean lash comb, also to comb off any big chunks of fibre.

But I decided to limit myself to mascara only if I was allowed to buy a nice one (had been using Maybelline Lash Stiletto for years and splurging on other makeup, mainly eyeshadows). I bought Blinc Blinc at first and hated it, then exchanged it for this. I am obsessed. I get so many compliments that my eyelashes look super long while I'm wearing this mascara. And, it's buildable and relatively smudgeproof compared to other waterproof mascaras. I've gone to sleep with it on and just added a bit more in the morning and it doesn't make my eyelashes stick together or feel crunchy.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Honestly, this liner is very very good. I like that the tip doesn't cause streaks so you get a solid black line and it dries fast & lasts long. My only problem with it is.. I guess the material of the tip? It is similar to the Stila liquid liner where the tip is a bit feather-y and not sturdy so I feel like I don't have control of the liner. I immediately felt that the tip will wear away after time. Bottom line is, if you're a bold/thick lined liner wearer like me, this isn't the eyeliner for you (eyeko may be more appropriate) but if you like your eyeliner thin, I say you should go for it!",12 06 2014,4 stars,Awesome liner but I won't repurchase,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,8.22E+18

Once I've curled and put on Diorshow, people ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes, that's how dramatic the look.

It's important to get the waterproof mascara, I've noticed that the normal formula seems too ""wet"" and straightens my lashes right away, even after I've curled them. But the waterproof formula holds the curl like it's hairspray for my lashes! Plus it will last all day.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I have the Marc Jacobs gel eye crayons in black, bronze with shimmer, and forest green. The colors are fantastic, but trying to smudge this can be a messy problem. Although it's a ""gel"", it's easy to smudge on the hand when played with in store. However, smudging on the eyelid becomes a real challenge, and I can never achieve the right smokey smudge that other eyeliners are able to give. Trying to sharpen the crayon can be difficult and wasteful of the expensive crayon. to get a decent crayon tip, I have to form it myself with a tissue.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've bought a lot of makeup products. Some of them I've hated and others I've loved. But my feelings towards them have never been strong enough on either side to warrant a review. Until now. 
This eyeliner... Ugh, it's just so AMAZING. The best thing about it for me is the super fine tip. I have really hooded eyes so it's hard for me to do my liner thick enough to be seen but thin enough so it doesn't take over what little eyelid space I have- But this little treasure did just that. Besides that- it's super pigmented and pretty much the perfect black. I didn't have any troubles at all with it drying out before I could finish both eyes (i've noticed that with some others and it makes me so angry!). It really does stay all day- I put it on in the morning as soon as the mailman dropped it off, and by the end of the night it looked as perfect as it did when I first applied it. I'm trying to think of a downside to this liner so it doesn't look like I'm robot reviewer to push sales (I promise I'm not), but I honestly can't think of a single one.",12 11 2016,5 stars,AMAZING.,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-6.22E+17

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"The reason why this product earned 4.5 stars instead of 5, in my opinion, is because of these few reasons: (pro's and con's) The first reason is its claim of being ""waterproof"" is not entirely true - if you were to splash water onto your face or to rub your eye with wet hands, some of the product WILL come off.. But keyword: some. Some of the eyeliner will still be on, just not as intense as it was before, looking a bit faded. What I do like about the eyeliner is that I have oily eyelids, and I have to use an eye primer to ensure that my eye makeup will endure throughout the day But this eyeliner will stay on my eyelid with and without eye primer no problem. Another pro is that this eyeliner has a felt-tip liner, which is PERFECT for people that have problems applying liquid eyeliner or are just beginners. It is very easy to use and I love that you have alot of control when using this product. I would recommend buying this liquid eyeliner because it's definitely better then the rest that I've used so far (drugstore and high-end) and $20 is not as expensive as other liquid eyeliners out there.",13 01 2012,4 stars,4.5 stars!

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I'm Asian, my lashes are not particularly short or thin but are dead straight - I need all the help I can get keeping the curl I achieve with a lash curler, and I'll never say no to more length and volume, obviously. This is the first non-Asian market mascara that will not relax the curl at all upon application. Lengthens/volumizes well without flaky fibers or clumping. I will say that it volumizes a smidge less than my fave Asian mascaras, but it actually wins over then in terms of staying feathery (2 applications, I do comb thru), and not getting that 'dusty' look mid-day. Pricey, yes, but worth it to someone with my lash situation. Wish the brush head was a bit narrower, hard to get at the roots of upper lashes, but it comes out of the bottle clean, and product distribution and application are very nice.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have very thick long lashes, and have had a problem finding a mascara that lasts more than three weeks, even with only one coat. I keep trying mascaras, hoping to find one that lasts longer, plus has a waterproof version just as good. I came back to this mascara (both waterproof and non-waterproof), because I haven't been able to find another one that lasts longer. Having to replace a tube of mascara every few weeks can be rather expensive, which is why I keep trying. I might find something that seems really good, but then the tube might not make it even three weeks, and I just don't want to pay that much money on a regular basis. I have friends who can go two months on a tube of mascara.

Having used this in the past, I knew it does an awesome job defining my lashes. The brush is good - it gets most of my lashes with one coat, and I go back and get the rest with a spherical brush. This brush is well designed to reach even small lashes. It gives me a well defined excellent effect. The staying power of this mascara is really good, and I wear it when I know I'll cry - weddings, graduations, water sports, sad movies... This mascara is great and creates some serious lash definition. The only reason I stopped wearing this was that the non-waterproof version didn't last long enough, and I ended up trying other things. A lot of other things...

Well, I'm back to this mascara for day wear when I need a waterproof mascara. (I like the Iconic at night when I want my lashes to fan out).

This is an excellent mascara. It lasts a very long time once applied, doesn't smear or smooth, and it doesn't run when I cry. I'm really pleased with it for my long lashes. I have friends who have very short sparse lashes who use this, along with the non-waterproof version, and it does awesome things for them, so I know this works for me, with my long lashes, and for them, with their short ones. It's really good and it's dependable. I highly recommend this mascara when you need one that's waterproof.

PS Waterproof mascaras are supposedly healthier, anyway, compared to their non-waterproof versions. because product doesn't rub off on skin or get into eyes.…read more",13 04 2010,5 stars,JET BLACK - A  GREAT BLACK WATERPROOF MASCARA,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,8.79E+18

Another plus: it creates a smooth line (as thin or as thick as you'd like), even if you don't have a particularly steady hand (I don't).

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"And it should be great at this price! After my fav brand, Bourjois Pump Up the Volume became seemingly discontinued, I began the search for something to take its place. In the end, it was between this and Bare Escentuals Weather Everything, which is a lot cheaper. But then I noticed that the DiorShow comes in a much larger size than the Weather Everything, and a little cross-multiplication revealed that they are pretty much the same price per ounce. So I went with DiorShow.

I've been wearing this for a few weeks now and I am ready to give my review. I wore this mascara everyday on a recent trip to Barbados. I went on a hike, I went to the beach, I went in the pool, and I even went snorkeling in it (yes, I am just that vain). This mascara did not budge 90% of the time I was wearing it - through water, rain, sweat, etc.

As others have said, the brush is kind of big, but I don't find it difficult to maneuver. I actually really like the brush - it delivers the mascara very effectively and makes my lashes look thicker and longer.

Definitely give it a try - it's actually not that much more expensive than its competitors!…read more",13 07 2009,5 stars,Great Stuff!,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,8.59E+18
Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I was a bridesmaid in my cousin's wedding...an outdoor wedding in the middle of June. I wanted to be close-up picture-perfect all day long without having to constantly touch-up. No easy task, even on a good day, thanks to my ultra oily skin...my make up is usually a muddy mess by lunch time. And it happened to be 90 degrees out the day of the wedding. I received a free sample of this stuff and decided to give it a try. It worked wonderfully! Our pictures were at 11 am, ceremony wasn't until 3:30 pm, with reception (and dancing) afterward. I didn't touch-up once! Lasted all day, and all night!

The product is very easy to apply...just spray it on! It is light-weight and non-greasy, didn't irritate my sensitive skin, and I didn't notice any fragrance. Also, it wasn't sticky and it didn't leave any marks or residue like with other finishing sprays I have tried in the past. I was impressed with it's performance and will be purchasing a large bottle for every-day use.

The picture provided was taken several hours after the ceremony, and after taking quite a few turns around the dance floor. As you can see (even from the horribly compressed pic), my make up is still in place.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I read several reviews on different waterproof mascaras trying to settle on one to take to the beach with me. This is the one that I decided on, and I am very pleased with how it held up in both the ocean and the pool. It is very 'wet' as far as texture goes, but once it was dry I didn't have any issues with smudging or flaking or anything. I was sweating, getting splashed with water and going under water but this mascara stayed put. I wore it for several hours each day and then used oil-free eye makeup remover to remove it at night. I will say that was a bit messy, but I bought it for the purpose of staying on in and around water and that is exactly what it did. Very please and would definitely recommend.

the pen tip stays moist, the pigment is rich and deep (i have black), and it continually goes on smoothly with no jagged lines or light spots. it never flakes off or smudges, even when it's on for my 12 hour work days. it's wonderfully waterproof, but comes off easily with eye makeup remover.

my only issue (not really a complaint) is i find the pen tips on these types of liquid eyeliners not quite as easy to control as a brush. i only wish the tip was a tad more flexible.

This product is mostly directed towards people who worry about water smudges (tears/humidity/pools ect). For myself I did not notice a finished look that make my lashes thicker or longer. This gives a look of natural lashes and its soft to the touch. I love long lashes so I typically help out this mascara by using my Tarte eyelash curler.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I'm so used to every company talking about how great and long-wearing their liners are, so I pretty much take these claims with a grain of salt. Imagine how shocked I was to find that this liner actually delivers!

I had just swiped this liner on my hand to see the color and went about my shopping at Sephora. On my way out I went to wipe it off my hand and it didn't budge. Like, at all. This led to me maniacally rubbing at it and still nothing. I was sold!

I've only used this on my waterline, but it's nice and creamy to apply and definitely gave me a longer wear than the Urban Decay 24/7 liners. One other significant difference was that it wore off very evenly, so instead of the splotchy-ness I get from other liners as the day goes on, it simply faded from black to a soft grey.…read more",13 09 2013,5 stars,Wow.,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-3.21E+17

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Tried this mascara a little while back and was very disappointed overall. I did find that it was very black and did give the visibility of longer lashes. That said, there was too much clumping (something you wouldn't expect to find at this price range), making application less than appealing. Honestly, the product would mostly transfer onto my lashes in clumps, and would leave them sticking together. Horrible. Also, this particular mascara felt very dry on my eyes and irritated them a lot (itching, tears). Gave it a good few weeks hoping my eyes would adjust to it, but never did. Sadly, the disappointment continued when the mascara dried out too quickly in the bottle, leaving me with little to any product to use.

I kept hearing Jen from frmheadtotoe raving about this mascara for months and used it constantly in almost of her recent videos, so because of that I gave it a try. Yes I did hope this could be 'that mascara'! I just got it today in the mail and I instantly put it on without eyelash curler and eyelash primer. I just put it on by itself. So it curled my lashes and dried really fast! It doesn't thicken my lashes when I applied the first coat, but after 2 coats my lashes look fuller and longer. I would have to say that there are some micro-fibers in the formula & I guess it for the lengthening (and thickening?) purposes. So far I am in love & excited that UD Cannonball is able to give me the best results that no other mascara can. Though I haven't get a chance to test whether if it is really waterproof or not, but I will able to this Friday when I go to the pool at my university.

This year, I wasn't expecting anything to come out of today, but a random guy in my college gave me the exact same rose that my grandfather used to get me. Personally, I see this as a sign so I got emotional and I cried. Then I got angry at myself because I had done my makeup and I was going to have to fix it because even though my mascara and eyeliner are waterproof, they always run. I was surprised to see that my makeup was intact. I recently bought this setting spray and I can tell you that it does the job.

The blue is definitely great for adding some drama to your look, and the black is great for an everyday look; it makes your eyes pop without looking too flashy. It's waterproof aspect is also great, but if you have oily eyelids like me or are in extremely humid conditions, you might experience a little bit of the mascara being transferred to you lower eye bags at the end of the day.

1. Comparing to the stila one, I think the staying power is about the same, and the precision is very similar.
2. The Kat Von D liner LAST FOREVER. You really get your money's worth with this little pen. I have owned 2 Stila ones in the past, both ran out of ink i less than 1.5 months. I can confidently say that the product in the Kat Von D pen will last 2-3 times longer than the Stila liner.
3. Much easier to wash off compared to the Stila liner (with makeup remover). Don't worry, this won't budge with just water.
4. Only con I can think of is the Stila liner is slightly more matte than the Kat Von D liner.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I bought this for the cottage and beach trips b/c i can't bare going makeupless. Clear mascara's can't hold a curl, and regular waterproof mascaras feel stiff and end up flaking instead of smearing. This mascara was a little bit stiff but the gel formula prevented flaking. This mascara withstood both the heat and swimming...even a shower. It gave good length and separation but took some extra effort to get any volume to my lashes. Its hard to take off. I use lancome's bi-facil to remove and it takes two cotton pads and i always lose an eyelash or two when i wear this mascara so i reserve it for occasions when i know i'll be in water. I would not recommend this mascara for daily wear. You'll damage your lashes trying to take it off at night! Best waterproof mascara though, i'll def repurchase next summer!

I was blown away by how easy it was and it dispenses product all on its own, which is phenomenal. I didn't have to worry about over clicking or over shaking. I like that this product does not over dispense and it isn't dry so I don't have to go over my eye 5-6 times just to get a hint of definition.

The price is completely on point also, I paid easily 5-12 dollars less than others I have tried in the past.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I have never used a makeup setting spray before this one. I was weary at first, I thought a makeup setting spray would make me feel stiff or sticky, (why I don't use hairspray), but this stuff is great!

I have really oily skin, which can be detrimental to my makeup. It can come off a little on oil absorbing sheets, and the oily-ness can cause my makeup to ""slide"" or ""melt"" off throughout the day. However, so far I have noticed that All-Nighter really makes a difference! My skin looks more ""glowy"" than oily, and I've actually barely had to use any oil absorbing sheets since I've used this product. My makeup also looks freshly applied all day; it prevents smudging and fading. I don't know what I'd do without this any more!

My advice would be MAKE SURE you are holding it the recommended distance away from your face -using this too close to your face would not be good and basically just get you wet. Also, even when holding the recommended distance away from your face, it's probably best to apply this BEFORE putting on mascara. I fan my face with my hands for a few seconds to dry, then apply my mascara. When I put my (not waterproof) mascara on before the spray, it smudged pretty badly. But waiting until after was perfect.",14 11 2014,5 stars,Helps Makeup Last for Oily Skin,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,8.07E+18

It doesn't smudge at all, it's a deep-deep black- so I don't need to apply multiple coats, and it applies like a dream. The tip is like a cross between a fine paintbrush and a marker, it's got that paint-brush shape, it's firm like a pen tip, and the end has just enough bend and flex that it moves well on the delicate skin around your eyes. 

It also LASTS, I can put this on in the morning and it's not going anywhere all day. I have pretty oily skin, so by the end of the night (read: 12 hours later) it will smudge a bit if I rub it, but otherwise- it's set for the entire day. Don't have to worry about accidentally rubbing your eye and ruining your makeup. Despite that, it comes off w/ a basic makeup wipe without having to scrub your retinas apart.

-put on moisturizer
-put on primer
-put on concealer and foundation
-spray all nighter spray all over face
-let it dry
-apply face powder

My makeup doesn't budge from when I apply it at 5:45am until I take it off at 11:30pm. I apply it as per the directions, I shake it first, close my eyes and do 2 spritzes in an 'X' shape and 2 in a 'T' shape. It is wet, but not sticky and it dries fast. The only time my makeup has moved at all while using this was when there was a small snowstorm a few days ago, but that has nothing to do with the product, that's just the joy of living in Canada.

Not to sound so dramatic, but seriously, I absolutely adore this eyeliner and it has made my daily make-up routine so much more convenient. It has made winging my eyes so easy a caveman could do it.

ON ME. which is saying something, because of the sweating thing.

i recommend this eyeliner to everyone, and they always thank me after they finally try it. this thing is unbelievable, i don't have enough amazing things to say about it. not only is it super waterproof but super black, which can be difficult with eyeliners - you know what i mean, trying to get a dark, black line and getting a sort of lighter colored layer of...something on your skin. not with this. furthermore, the felt tip makes the application very very easy, although when you start running out of the actual eyeliner liquid, it becomes harder to use said felt tip. whatever...just buy a new one!

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"This makeup is sticky as others have mentioned, but it is perfect for long wear. It does not feel ""sticky"" on the skin; it is only sticky in the sense that it will hold your makeup. I have very oily skin and have literally tried probably 12-15 other primers of all brands and price ranges. They are all ""velvety"" but slide off my skin and actually make it feel more oily. This is absolutely the only one I have found that will control my oil. I use it on my clients and time after time I get feedback that they are glad they didn't spend the extra money on airbrush makeup, because this looked and stayed just as long.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I am a big fan of Clinique’s high impact mascara, but with the onset of allergy season and an upcoming funeral to attend- I desperately needed something waterproof. I read the reviews for Clinique (which weren’t all that great) and then read the most recommended on Sephora’s site. I was a little hesitant in getting DiorShow because of the price – but it was worth EVERY PENNY!

This mascara did not run, smudge or flake at all the day my tears were flowing for 12+ hours. What I loved most about it was the brush and the ease of putting it on. The brush was fuller than Clinique’s high impact, so I got longer, fuller, thicker lashes. I couldn’t believe it stayed put all day. I read the other reviews about the flaking and that didn’t happen to me at all. You don’t need numerous coats either, just brush it through until all lashes are evenly coated – it looks like professionally done lashes after application.

There was no real gliding of the pencil. The point is not very sharp so it was hard to get a nice, sharp, defined line. Smudging or blending the line was impossible, as it just rubbed off to bare skin.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I was SUPER impressed when I swatched these in store on my hand, they didn't budge and were so pigmented. In need of a great liner for my waterline, I justified the $25 price tag in my mind and splurged on both the Black and Jazzberry. I was even more impressed when I went home and took a bath and a shower and the swatches were still on my hand! Heavy duty makeup remover finally did the trick. Let me just say the Jazzberry is very unique and an amazing metallic cranberry color perfect for fall/winter. The issue I have is that, like every other liner I've ever worn on the waterline, there is some wear throughout the day. Its not a big deal, I've never found anything that stays on truly as well as when it is first applied throughout the day. The trouble is you can't reapply this liner on top of itself...like AT ALL!!! I tried to make the liner a little bolder and touch up the spots that were wearing and it was a disaster! Once it is dry, if you try to go back over it, layering the product, you end up with these tiny little chunks of dried liner flaking off in your eye. Its really annoying and they were hard to get out of my eye. I felt like I had little pebbles in them until I completely washed it off. At least with Kohl liners, you can layer them on top if needed to intensify...no such luck with these gel liners.

Second, with the new packaging I've found that once you're getting a little low, you have to squeeze hard to get more out which can end up in a huge blob of it coming out.

I don't know if it's because I have oily skin that it faded away so fast (almost like it had washed away) or because of something else. I figured I'd give it another chance, this time using primer so I wouldn't get oily, and still the wing faded away and it looked smudged despite me not touching it.

The only downside of this eyeliner is that because it's so long-lasting, it's kinda hard to take off. You have to use waterproof makeup remover to take it off - a wipe won't suffice.",15 12 2014,5 stars,Best.eyeliner.ever,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-4.56E+18

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"Let me begin by saying that Too Faced is my go-to brand. I love all of their products.... Except this guy.
I compare this product to their other primer: Primed and Poreless, which is a PERFECT primer. It smooths the skin, feels great, makes foundation look great.
Hangover primer was totally disappointing. It makes my skin look BAD. It is supposed to have a coconut scent to it, which I was looking forward to because coconut is my favorite. But instead, it smells more like melted crayons. Putting it on... I feel like I need a ton because it just does nothing to replenish the moisture in my skin. My skin feels dryer once I put it on--but in a thirsty way. My skin also looks red and blotchy after applying. Then the makeup goes on top... And this stuff just does not behave like a primer. I have better results putting just foundation on without priming my skin. But it gets worse because after an hour or so, I have extremely visible pores, makeup caking and peeling off, and dry skin patches that were previously not noticeable.
I've tried this stuff many ways... After exfoliating and moisturizing even, and it's always the same.
Maybe I got a bad bottle. I don't understand.
I pair this with a face full of Too Faced makeup. Still bad results.
I highly recommend Primed and Poreless.…read more",16 02 2016,1 star,Too Faced can do better,https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,-7.88E+18

It also makes your lashes long and feathery, and the black is nice and glossy. It stays in place really well and doesn't even flake into my eyes when I forget to take it off at night. I have really sensitive eyes, and my eyes don't burn from this at all. All in all, this is a fantastic mascara. I'm a mascara junkie, but this is one I'll definitely buy again. One tip: I've found that this stuff actually looks better without a primer. I usually use the Dior primer, but it kind of clumps this mascara.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I truly think this is one of the best liners I have ever used. I have never used a gel liner before, but since this was in pencil or ""crayon"" form, I decided it was best for travel. I purchased the shades Blacquer, Ro(Cocoa), and Brown(Out). The Brown(Out) and Blacquer shades glided on so smoothly with ease and lasted forever. I have monolids and these liners did not budge. I don't doubt the staying power, however, I have seemed to have gotten an old liner in the Ro(Cocoa) shade. It did not go on as smoothly and even tugged my eyelid during application, resulting in an uneven and splotchy line. I'm not sure if it was because it was an old liner or if it was because it had a different formula than the others. Also for those of you who are in between Ro(Cocoa) or Brown(Out), I recommend Brown(Out). It is more neutral, while Ro(Cocoa) is a warmer shade with copper undertones. Brown(Out) does have shimmer in it with a brassy undertone, but I find it more flattering overall.",16 06 2015,4 stars,"Good ""Crayon"", Inconsistent Formula",https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-8.22E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"Ok, here is the scoop.

I am a make up junky. I love make up. I love eye liner, and am always looking for the best that will not smudge, stays put, and doesnt leave raccoon eyes at 2pm, middle of my day.

The Good: Serious stay put. It doesnt move throughout the day. It is on my waterline for good. I was in desperate search for a water line eyeliner. This is it. It is super black.

The Bad: I am a contact lens wearer. If you get this on your lenses, holy mother. It hurts. A lot. It just doesnt wipe off either. It doensnt really come off of your lenses either if you have an accident. It burns, and its just a pain throughout the day for me. Warning for my contact lens wearers, be real real careful. The first time I wore this, it was making my eyes water a bit, but I did get used to it, and my eyes no longer water.

I would like to give 4.5 stars, but thats not an option. Hope this helped!…read more",16 07 2014,4 stars,"Good, but with warning.",https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,1.71E+18
Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Bought this to try a better waterproof mascara and it does work very well the only problem is it's a fiber mascara. In the description of it Urban Decay doesn't tell you it has fibers in it which is why I was surprised when I started getting all this irritation the first two times I used it. Honestly I wouldn't have bought this if I knew it was a fiber mascara since my eyes are so sensitive. It does work and doesn't smudge but the fibers will start flaking off during the day. So just be careful putting it on so you don't get fibers irritating your eyes.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"actually this is my FIRST review on sephora. I like old version ten times better than this new version. Let's talk about the applicator. They didn't have an applicator before, but now they do. when I first order, applicator was missing. So I called the sephora, and they automatically send the new one without charging it again. Thanks sephora for decent service. However, the second one came with broken applicator, too. I think it is a problem of the new version. without the applicator, the tube itself has a huge hole.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I had never used a setting spray before this. I had heard that they're amazing, but just never wanted to spend the extra money on something I thought was so trivial.
This was until I started wearing a full face of makeup and realized that my glasses completely rubbed off the entire portion of makeup that they touched. I'm very pale with extremely red spots. Which means that my entire nose would be bright pink and the rest of my face would be an average skin color.
So I bought the travel size of this to test out. And I seriously ran out after about six uses. I went setting spray crazy!
It helped to prevent so much foundation rubbing off of my nose! It didn't completely eliminate the problem, because I have a tiny nose and large glasses. So it's inevitable. But this was an extreme difference.

The lady at the store convinced me to go with this one in the brown. I was worried that the shade wouldn't be dark enough and not accent my eyes. I was wrong! This is a deep shade of brown and worked beautifully on my blue eyes. (Black is too harsh for me, so I usually go with a brown-black mascara and this was similar to that in my opinion.) I found it nicely defined my lashes and wasn't clumpy or vampy in any way. (I hate those volumizing mascaras that make your lashes look like freaky spiderwebs!) It also stayed put through my long work day and didn't end up under or around my eyes.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I think most of the mixed reviews of this product are due to Too Faced’s own marketing misnomer.

Too Faced is definitely a makeup brand. They haven’t gotten much into the skincare game yet... and to fit with their current branding and make this a step in the Too Faced “foundation routine,” this was labeled as a “primer.”

It’s really not. No more than any other moisturizer, at least. Of course, makeup DOES apply and last longer on well-moisturized skin. But this doesn’t have the smoothing or prolonging power of a dedicated “makeup primer” designed to do just that. If you want a longer wear for your makeup, the Urban Decay Primer Potions and setting sprays are a better bet. And if you desire something skin-smoothing you’ll want a formula with silicon.

What this IS is a really nice, nourishing daytime moisturizer. People with oily skin know they don’t NEED this sort of day time moisturizer--they’d go for a gel or something oil-free, if anything--so if Too Faced hadn’t called this a “primer” they could have avoided a lot of the unhappy reviews from oily-skinned people who were hoping for something with more “priming” qualities.

As a daytime moisturizer, I really like this stuff. I prefer a dewy finish so this works great for my combination skin.

This one doesn't work for me. After about 20 minutes post-application it starts seeping into my eyes and coats my contacts with a haze, so that about an hour in my vision is so blurred I'm nearly blind. The upside is that I could wash it off my contacts (other formulas stick like glue and there's no getting it off) so I didn't ruin 3 pairs of contacts over the 3 days I was testing it. I used it like a standard liner to get a bit of a wing effect and it was great for that, as far as ease of use. It's more of a dark grey than a true black, which in some ways makes it more foolproof - and it doesn't gush out of the pen like some formulas, which makes it easier to control.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I love this face primer by Too Faced. This primer's job is supposed to hydrate, smooth, and brighten skin and it does just that. It really gives me that dewy, healthy looking finish, but not oily. I wore this the whole day and by the evening my skin still look refreshed and makeup was flawless.

It does have a brightening effect which is a plus if you have uneven skin tone. Also, I have normal skin and it did not make my skin oily whatsoever. Tip: You do not need a lot of product - apply a pea size for the whole face is all you need.

It is a silicone-free facial primer that boost skin’s radiance and moisture thanks to an infusion of coconut water. It would be perfect for those with dry or aging skin.

This does have a subtle coconut water scent. The formula is a thinner, creamy texture that applies with a bit of stickiness at first, but definitely sets to a dewy finish.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have been wearing makeup for many years and never have I found a mascara that I liked enough to use.

The challenge is that I am Asian and my lashes are short, straight and sparse. Not a lot of Asian women I know like to use mascara because it usually is not very effective. I have accepted the fact that I will have to depend on my Shu Uemura curler for the rest of my life, but I've thrown out tons of mascara tubes which purported to be lengthening, thickening, etc.

Then I was introduced to this amazing mascara at the Sephora store by one of the Dior makeup consultants. She put a single coat on each of my eyes and I was seriously stunned. My lashes looked lush and full and even slightly curled without an eyelash curler! The pigment is super black and rich on me and the brush is huge and fluffy. The impact was tripled once I curled my lashes and then applied it!

It is also almost 100% waterproof. There is a tiny bit of smudging after several hours of wear, but I never need to reapply. It stays on all day, I have tend to have ""moist"" eyes, which was always a problem for me. Color me impressed.

I only have 2 drawbacks. The first is that because the brush is so big, i have problems catching my puny lower lid lashes. This is definitely not the mascara brush for short lower lashes. I was able to solve that by taking a smaller mascara brush and putting a little of the DiorShow product on it and gently catching the remaining lower lashes.

The other is that it is really difficult to take off. I use a gentle cream to loosen it at the end of the day and then tissue off. But when I wash my face, I still get residue. I just picked up the MUFE remover though and it has eliminated most of these issues as well.

All in all, this is the mascara that changed the way I thought about mascara. Highly recommended for Asian lashes!!!…read more",17 04 2010,5 stars,Finally--a mascara for straight Asian lashes!,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,5.39E+18

This is the first eyeliner that literally stays put all day, where even the sharpest point is unsmudged. The brush is also amazing too. Felt tipped eyeliners that I've used in the past kept fraying up and erasing my lines as I tried to make the lines thicker and they were never truly black. This brush glides effortlessly and is actually truly black. Using an eyelash curler after I used to apply eyeliner always took the eyeliner with it when I put it against my eye. This is a problem no longer. It really does not budge. Even on long days outside where I'm sweating, this eyeliner stays put. The best part is that while it doesn't move, it comes off easily when it's time to take my makeup off.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"Since receiving these two eyeliners a few months ago, I have literally not worn any other liners...they are that good. I am not particularly adventurous with eyeliner shades, so I stayed in my comfort zone and ordered (Stone)Fox, which is a charcoal grey with gorgeous silver shimmer, and Brown(out), which is a deep, bronze-y brown with gold shimmer. I'd say they are basics, but there is really nothing basic about them. With almost effortless ease, these both glide across the lid like silk and leave behind a surprisingly complex line of shimmering color. The shimmer is just perfect - not too glittery or over-the-top, so it's a great option for both day and evening..You have a little bit of time to smudge the line out, if you so desire, but both of these set quickly and stay put. Though both shades work beautifully with eyeshadows, I most often wear them alone as they are so pretty that I hate to cover them up in any way. If you want a super-thin, precise line, be sure to use the included sharpener as the liner is very soft and does tend to create a thicker line after a few uses. I personally like a little thicker line, especially on my upper lid, as I want to show off these gorgeous shades and shimmer. Now that I've tried and fallen head over heels with these, I'm putting (Luna)tic at the top of my wishlist. I've heard a rumor that there is going to be a Holiday 2014 set of these highliners.

They must have changed the formulation or maybe the thicker part is staying at the bottom of the tube which you really cannot get out. What a shame. Such a terrific product and Urban Decay ruined it.

FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA,Flyliner Longwear Liquid Eyeliner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I was really excited to try this product when it was announced and snagged a trial size through a promo. Unfortunately when all was said and done, I was not a fan. The tip of pen reminds me a lot of Stila's ""Stay All Day"" liquid liner as it's made of felt as opposed to consisting of actual brush bristles which I much prefer (I'm an avid fan of Clinique's ""Pretty Easy"" liquid liner!) and because of this, the tip has the potential to dull/fray and lose some of its ability to produce super fine lines. The pen's shape does make it easy to hold and color pigmentation is good, but the formula takes quite a bit of time to actually dry. This especially posed a problem for my tapered Asian lids. It kept smearing/bleeding before it had the ability dry fully. I've really enjoyed a lot of FENTY's products up until this point, but I've gotta pass on the Flyliner. It isn't an unusable product per say-- just not what I (personally) look for in a liquid liner. :P",17 10 2018,2 stars,"<img src=""https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2094258+sw.jpg"" alt="""" class=""css-1ctithg "" role=""presentation"" data-comp=""Image Box"">Color: Cuz I'm Black",https://www.sephora.com/product/flyliner-longwear-liquid-eyeliner-P17876556?icid2=products%20grid:p17876556,-4.72E+17

Normally the cleansing oil will do the good job and remove all the water-proof make up, but for this mascara I need one more step with eye makeup remover first. Secondly, it smudges badly as drug store brands, that really disappointed me.

It's so easy to apply, dries quickly, and stays put until you remove it with makeup remover. I'm so happy I finally decided to try this.
I'm able to create a subtle cat-eye, with thinner lines, or a dramatic look with thicker lines. Nearly foolproof. If I need to clean up the wing a bit, I just use a qtip (damp with water or makeup remover, or dry) to perfect it. I use the dark brown, which basically appears black on my fair skin.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Okay so I bought this mascara a while ago and haven't bought a different mascara since. I have medium length, fairly thin, lashes that are STRAIGHT. Every other mascara I use makes my lashes fall back down once it's applied. Except this one. For people who have lashes that aren't naturally curled this one is great! It is pretty waterproof and stays all day. However it does flake here and there but for me this isn't really a problem. It is more difficult to take off because of the waterproof formula. The brush is pretty small so you can create definition and it is pretty good for layering. After a while of use it dries and clumps a little in the bottle but by then it's time to buy a new one anyways. The main thing I want to emphasis is that IT KEEPS A CURL. That is so hard for me to find in a mascara. The color is deep black. I haven't had a problem with smearing, like if you were to work out and sweat in it. For those who are curious I am fairly certain that this isn't sold in stores (at least I haven't seen it) so you do have to order it online.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"Like most people, I have heard about Urban Decay's Primer Potion for a very long time. It seems that every makeup artist, tutorial, or blog mentions this product. I don't typically buy high-end makeup so I just resisted this product. I did buy cheaper versions of this: I've used Loreal's eye primer, as well as ELF.
I must say there is absolutely no comparison. Urban Decay's product is an absolute essential for making eyeshadow look great and to ease in blending. There is a reason for the hype!
I purchased the tube in the original formula (no color). The price was around twenty dollars plus tax. The packaging is nice, and the tube is pretty large. You do get a LOT of product for your money. I think if I were to really add it up mathematically, the cost per usage would be much better than any cheaper version.
I had a big event to go to so I decided to purchase. I was doing some pretty dramatic eye makeup and wanted to use that as an opportunity to try this product out. I was blown away. Blending was easier, the colors of the makeup really 'popped' (I was wearing teal/turquoise eyeshadows with some gold). More importantly, the eyeshadow looked unbelievably fresh for the entire party (around 7 hours) and even when I was washing off the makeup later that night, there was not any sign that the eye makeup had been applied hours earlier.
Truly a fantastic product.
I will be buying this again and again. In fact, I will make sure to always have this in my makeup bag.
Highly recommended!",18 06 2012,5 stars,Amazing Product!,https://www.sephora.com/product/eyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716?icid2=products%20grid:p284716,-1.87E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Good:
- Great pen tip. Easy to create both thick and thin lines, and very easy to apply. I recommend starting from the outer corner and working your way in, if you're doing a cat eye.
- Very long lasting. I have worn it for 2 days straight when I pulled an all-nighter for work. Not optimal, but it still looked almost completely flawless.
- Pretty good black. I usually do 2 coats, which isn't too difficult to apply. It also dries fairly quickly, so you can do 2 coats very fast.
- Long pen makes it easy to grip, and the learning curve is less steep than other liquid liners.
- Appears to last a long time. Mine has lasted a couple months of almost daily usage, and is just now starting to show signs of running out.
- Price/Value ratio. It appears to function for almost 3 months under daily use, with varying thicknesses of line. That kind of makes it worth the $18, and the easy-to-use pen.

Cons:
- Pen dries out quickly. This was an issue at the beginning more, when it took me longer to apply my makeup. Now, it usually only takes me one pen, but I have a backup liner just in case, or to use for a second coat.…read more",18 06 2013,4 stars,The Good and the Bad: Trooper,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-4.85E+18

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I am a brand loyalist, and Stila was always on my black-balled list. Whether it's because I am not into lip gloss (and that seems to be Stila's biggest seller) or because, in my experience, their eyeshadows are pretty mediocre (and eyeshadow is of utmost importance to me), I never really felt the need to spend relatively large amounts of money on products that I just didn't need or want when there was something better available. This eyeliner is a total exception to the rule, however.

I used to use liquid liner a lot in college because it was so humid that regular kohl/crayon liner would melt off my face within 2 hours. After I moved back home, the need for the liquid dissipated, but with the recent heat wave we've been getting, I needed to reconnect with the trusty liquid alternative, and I really didn't feel like getting something gross at the drug store. Sephora had a $10 promotional sale on the mini Stila, so I figured it was worth a shot.

I am blown away by how precise, easy, clean, and long-wearing this liner is. The brush is the perfect size (drugstore brushes are often too thick or too thin), the perfect firmness (nothing worse than a flimsy tip!), and the ink goes on smoothly. The stuff dries instantly and provides the perfect line. For the first time in ages, I was actually able to do a clean 60s wing look without looking like a vampy retro vintage pinup derby girl (not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm a professional and can't show up to work looking all edgy and alternative with my makeup). This stuff stays put in 90 degree heat and 180% humidity, so I will DEFINITELY be repurchasing this gem, and recommending it to all my friends!

Plus, on my medium deep skin (I'm 3Y12 on the Sephora Pantone scale) the other colors often didn't show up as being very colorful. I tried Dark Brown, Moss, and Indigo.

I have never had anything stay on my lower waterline (not even the revered UD Perversion which drifted within an hour), but I am now many hours into my day and it looks new and fresh.

There is one weird thing, and that is that it is blacker on the lower waterline than on the lashline--meaning that I guess it is not that opaque. Perversion is darker, but doesn't stay.  So, I just set the eyeliner over the lashline with carbon black eyeshadow and boom! 

But the real coup here is that I've never been able to tightline before, and finally I can. This formula is so cream that it goes right on.",18 07 2016,5 stars,Finally I can TIGHTLINE!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-5.68E+18

Tom Ford,Emotionproof Mascara,Mascara,"For me, this mascara is worth its high price. I have tried several top-rated waterproof & smudge proof mascaras (high-end & drugstore brands) that have failed me. But not this one!!!

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"My best friend gave me my first DiorShow last Christmas. At first I was hesitant to start using waterproof mascara since I had to start washing with eye makeup remover instead of just with my normal face wash. I let the mascara sit for a couple months before I gave it a chance. But then I became curious to try it out since I heard that waterproof mascara holds curl better. I typically curl with my eyelash curler for at least 10 minutes since my Asian lashes so stubbornly stick-straight. As soon as I put on my old (non water proof mascara) they would turn immediately stick straight again.

The first time I tried DiorShow I fell in love. My lashes stayed curly after I used this mascara and it did not clump at all. Also doesn't smudge through my long work day. If I go out at night, I just swipe a few more strokes of DS and I'm set to go.

I think I need to shake it up a bit more than I already do and it'll be fine. When it does fade, it just fades instead of flaking off or anything like that. Overall I still haven't decided if I will repurchase since I am more of a gel/cream liner girl, but as far as liquid liners good, this would be one of my top favorites.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"Let me preface this review by saying I have little luck with pencil-type liners even popular ones like UD's 24/7 and MUFE's Aqua Liners leave me with panda eyes.

Needless to say, I was surprised when my Marc Jacobs liner had stayed put, especially considering how soft the tip is. It does glide and stay well, but the softness of the gel pencil is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, as it's pretty much never going to be at a nice point unless you're constantly sharpening.

Supposedly the liner was supposed to be very long wearing, smudgeable but still permanent when dry, and easy to remove with eye remover. When I purchased this liner it did everything that she promised it WOULDN'T do and did NOTHING she promised that it would do. My eyes watered with it, it was impossible for me to get a good line without it smearing all over my lid, during the day I found it running from the corner of my eye, and to top it all off it was impossible to remove at night.

It's an amazing mascara for daily wear as well, not just waterproof activities. It's lengthening, volumizing, long wearing, and just awesome. Sure, it will begin to get smudgy after a hot shower and face wash, but it's not permanent!

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"While this mascara is very waterproof, it has several cons: 1) Dries really fast into a brittle feel, so it's not possible to build multiple layers. Doing so will just cause clumping 2) The mascara doesn't lengthen or give volume, it just gives definition, so your lashes look darker. 3) Smudges after a few hours, even with a primer 4) I have a nice natural curl and this mascara straightens them out. 5) I have a good amount of lashes, and using this makes my lashes look thin and uneven. 6) the WORST part is because it dries my lashes to a brittle feel, removing it causes lash fall out. I use the softest Shiseido cotton and Shiseido makeup remover, a very gentle process, and still 3-4 lashes fell out from each side. I had high hopes for this, since I tend to love all of UD's products. This is awful.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have a slight monolid with a small crease in the eyes sometimes, so it has always been a problem finding the perfect eyeliner that will not crease or smudge when I blink. I have never used a liquid eye liner before, but after hearing all the rave about this product I decided to try it out.

To my surprised it works beautifully, it does not crease, it glides on really well with the applicator, it is water/smudge proof, comes of very easily with make up remover wipes (you would think it being a waterproof product that it would be hard to get off, but nope! =) )

I would have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because during the application it can sometimes give a cracked look, but all you have to do is wait for it to dry a little and reapply over and it will be fine.

I have a video review on this product for further information

I used this product after applying my makeup on 2 occassions where I'd be out for a night and the other being outside for the day. Several people asked me how I got my makeup to last so long. Being a makeup artist, first I did want to let them know the type of foundation I was using but, I told them of this new product I bought by Urban Decay called the ""All Nighter"" that was supposed to set makeup and help it stay in place. It definitely did its job because I didn't have to use oil-blotting papers or powder any areas the entire time. I did buy the trial size bottle but, will surely buy the full size once I'm out.

Stila’s eyeliner is the only liquid eyeliner that has been able to hold up against my watery eyes.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I've been using this primer for years... back from when it had the original hard tube and stick applicator packing. Back then, the primer was still the same excellent product that they have today, but I would have given it two stars just for the really awful packaging. It was impossible to get anything out, you had to take a hand saw to it (not kidding). Then came the squeeze tube packaging and it changed everything. I stored it upside-down (cap down) to make sure I got every last bit out. Now with the new packaging, you get the best of both worlds: people who like the applicator and people who like the squeeze tube both get what they want. I personally don't care for the applicator, I end up using my fingers to blend it anyway.

BUT, as another reviewer said, this will turn gunky and disgusting if it comes in contact with your foundation. I have used foundations from NARS, UD, Hourglass, Lancome, MUF, liquids, creams, powders, tinted moisturisers... you name it, I've tried it. If there's ANY traces of foundation on your eyelids and it mixes with this primer, it will look like you spread glue stick on your lids and you won't be able to blend any eyeshadow. Your best bet is to do your eye makeup first and then do your face makeup, or just avoid putting foundation on your lids.

Also, with this new packaging, you're getting less product. With the squeeze tube you got 0.37oz. With this new one you only get 0.33oz. It's very slight, but still annoying and I saw someone else comment that there was more product in this newer version, which is simply not true. The new tube might LOOK bigger to accommodate the applicator inside, but it indeed has less product.

Other than that, this product is great. I'm extremely oily (I use 3-4 blotting sheets every time I blot, and I blot at least 3-4 times a day) and I've never had any issues with eyeshadow not showing, creasing, or sliding off. I've never used any other brands though, so I can't compare.…read more",19 04 2015,4 stars,"Excellent primer, BUT...",https://www.sephora.com/product/eyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716?icid2=products%20grid:p284716,2.99E+18

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've tried pretty much every type of eyeliner out there. Pencils leave too thick a line. The cake liners either don't give an opaque coverage or depend too much on finding the perfect application brush. Gel, again, leave too thick a line and are hard to spread evenly. And finally, the liquid liners in the inkwell-style packaging get the liner all over my lashes, causing me to have to use a lash comb to remove everything before I can curl my lashes. This, however, is different. I've tried plenty of marker-style liners, but they either skipped, dragged, or were too sheer. This one by Stila is perfect. It applies easily with a very thin line and gives an opaque, dark, glossy finish. Especially good is that it doesn't get caught in my lashes, which eliminates all of the combing I'd been doing. It stays on all day without budging and is even truly waterproof, but it's not difficult to remove.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I bought the black one. When using it on the waterline I find this product to be smudgable but on the skin I find that you don't have a lot of time to work with this as it dries really fast. This is a long lasting formula but I have tried other products out there that are longer lasting and less expensive. Stila waterproof eyeliner and Blinc Eyeliner Pencil are longer lasting. I have extremely oily skin too and found the others worked better for me.

I do love the other colours in this line up and I find the product easy to use as you just roll it up. The down fall is that I like a sharp tip when doing eyeliner for myself and clients. Marc Jacobs products come beautifully packaged but there are no instructions except for pictures. I feel like buying an Ikea product. The beauty associates at Sephora did not tell me about the sharpener that is built in. And for those of you are are stilll looking for it, it is on the cap or the product where you twist the product up.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've always used pencil liners because I'm intimidated by liquid (I don't know why - maybe everyone says liquid is more difficult to apply). But even with pencils, I find that I can't get the cleanest look I want (I'm not very good at applying makeups). So I decided to give liquid eyeliner a try.

I'm so glad I found this product! It really lives up to all the raving reviews! Just got it today in mail and immediately put it on to try.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have really thin, sparse, stick-straight typical Asian eyelashes and so I have been using Asian (mostly Chinese or Japanese) mascaras for a long time, which is why I am so happy to have found this mascara. It holds curl really well, adds great definition by separating each last, and is very easily build-able for greater length and depth. It isn't a volumizing mascara, but it does add enough to make a big difference to lashes like mine and avoids the whole gross clumping/sticking issue. in turn, it also keeps the formula very flexible and natural-looking too, which I love. I do agree with some other reviews that this mascara is a bit pricey, but I've been paying approximately $20 for my old mascaras anyways. I live in Canada, and any in-store Asian mascaras in retail stores are marked up a lot (way more than they are worth), and ordering online also has the added cost of shipping which always brings the cost to about $15-$20. Plus, ordering online adds waiting time, which isn't always easy when it comes to make up essentials like mascara.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have never really used waterproof because it's such a pain to remove usually. Plus I felt like the formulas were clumpy. I have now replaced my MAC Opulash with this. It gives great separation, great length, and with proper eye-lining it even has great volume. The formula is good, and the brush is as well. The brush is more on the stiffer side, so if you hate the plastic ones due to how it feels, you may not like this. The brush is small so it can get every lash without causing you to look like you have a black eye. It rinses off easily with eye make up remover (I use target brand). Overall I am super shocked at how good this is because I haven't ever tried UD mascaras due to reputation. Yes, it's $20, but it's very well spent. I think this out does DiorShow (especially black out eck!) in overall appearance. Best summer mascara.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"This shadow primer is by far the best I've ever used! I don't usually write reviews because not many products are exceptionally good (or bad), so I don't bother. But this is one product that everyone needs. I have tried multiple primers (Too Faced, Smashbox, NARS, LORAC) and this one outlasts them all. My eye shadow goes on with a more vibrant and true color than it does without a primer. But above that, it lasts all day and into the evening. My shadow doesn't end up with those lines in the crease of my eye at all; my shadow stays smooth and fresh looking all day.

I haven't yet tried the new MUFE primer, but I'd be surprised if it is possible to be better than UD. And I do think the tube is preferable to a wand, from the standpoint of being easier to apply, and also getting every last bit of product out. But with that said, I'll probably try the MUFE at some point, for the sake of comparison :)",20 06 2012,5 stars,Best eye shadow primer ever,https://www.sephora.com/product/eyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716?icid2=products%20grid:p284716,-5.08E+18

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have been using this liner for a couple of months now, and as a cat-eye enthusiast this is by far the best product I've tried. The applicator is pretty no nonsense, if I do mess up it's due to having an unsteady hand not because the applicator is difficult to control. The color is very strong, which is perfect for some added drama. When first applied it is possible to smudge it which is ok because when you make a mistake it's easily fixable. Once dried the product becomes a little flakey, so if you do end up crying or what have you it won't smear your tears will be covered in flakes though. This stands up well too heat and cold (where I live the temps range from -40f to 90f), and as long as you don't have very moist eyes there's no reason this producer wouldn't last you all day.",20 06 2014,4 stars,"Great application, with OK hold",https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,6.11E+18
Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I have been looking for a no-run liner forever, and gel seems to be the way to go. When this came out, I was very excited to try it--gel in stick form?!

The color is great, and quite pigmented. It goes on smoothly.

However, I find it very hard to remove; after 3 or 4 days of wearing it I started getting buildup around the base of my eyelashes. In addition, the crayon is thick; maybe it's just me but I have never figured out how to successfully use that little ""sharpener"" on the end of the retractable eyeliners.

I wish this really was like a gel pot eyeliner, but it not as precise as a gel pot, it builds up more than a gel pot, and it doesn't stay put as long as a gel pot.

If you want gel eyeliner, I would suggest going with a gel pot.",20 06 2014,3 stars,High Hopes...,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,4.13E+18

I purchased this in Indigo and believed the color would be brighter due to the brighter blue packaging but honestly, the color is exactly as it's name suggests. It's Indigo; a very, very dark blue. More midnight blue than Cobalt. Below is a swatch of it along side Lancome's Artliner in Navy. Navy is more cobalt.

Overall, I actually really like my indigo eye liner, It's a great alternative to my daily black cat eye. The blue is very subtle. You can tell it's blue mostly in a close range.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"What a great product....I am not sure there is a better primer out there right now. I had read about Two Face's Hangover Replenishing Primer in a well known beauty magazine where it received rave reviews. I am not a fan of primers, I find the silicone based ones too slick, and end up doing the opposite of what they are designed to do.
I find the cream based ones too thick....whether its creamy in texture, or silicone based: my make up is shiny and
slipping in a matter of hours. So I stopped using primers, but being the product junkie I am, decided to give this new one a try.
So glad I did! The texture is thin, no silicones, my skin absorbs it in no time. I hardly have to wait at all for it to set so I can apply my foundation.
The formula smells a little odd....herbal like?...but it's not an over powering scent. It kind of gives a slight tingling sensation too, but it does not irritate my skin. Once it absorbs there is no scent.
The result is just lovely....a soft focus inner glow that lasts all day and keeps my foundation fresh looking.
I am not sure it evens out my skin tone, but it does appear to make the areas on my face where my pores are more visible, a lot less visible.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I fell in love with the n(ice) silver color in the Sephora store. I purchased it originally to take on Bonaroo 2014 with an attention-grabbing look and also for youtube videos. The store had sold out completely of the Luna(tic), so that is a color to check out for sure because it was significantly more popular or less well stocked. The employees confirmed that the color had been swooped up the fastest.

I ordered the Blacquer and by far it is the smoothest black that glides on opaque in one stroke. If you're not getting that one stroke thing, try warming it in your hands for a while. It is really hard to remove this gel liner, but that's the point. I was disappointed that there wasn't a white color.

The mari(gold) is a deeper gold with luster. If you have an olive or darker skin-tone, it can easily create a convincing Egyptian look from Old Hollywood.

All the colors seem to have different properties--which makes sense since different pigments come from different places. The black is the one I would recommend for men and women alike. Guyliner dudes, this one is a must have. I know they are twenty-five dollars each but it is an investment that people will compliment you on all day! All my friends whom see it on me ask what the black is especially.

Amazing! I can apply in the morning and don't need to worry about raccoon eyes or reapplying until night, even if I go to the gym mid-day. I haven't tried but am confident I could swim in this.

It doesn't flake, doesn't smudge, is truly waterproof, and makes my lashes super long and super lush!!

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I am so glad i decided to get this mascara. UD you've outdone yourself. girls this mascara ..is AMAZING.. 1) holds curl instantly - the dry formula holds lashes exactly how they are curled all day and doesn't flake. apply this where your lashes are curled near the base for extra lift 2) extremely water proof - i live in Toronto so snow and wind usually mean runny mascara. definitely not the case with this. i wear this allllll over my lower lashes and not a smudge all day!! bye bye raccoon eyes. its even a little hard to take off. i need to invest in a better makeup remover! 3)fibers add volume and length - the fibers are quite fine so you don't really see them but they are working. adding additional layers will add volume with no added weight. 4) separates lashes - the brush is small compared to others and has short bristles so i was quite skeptical about its separating abilities but i was proven wrong. really wiggle the brush around horizontally to get the little bristles between the lashes the one thing about this mascara, is that its not as dark as i'd like it to be. So for those days you want that added drama in your eyes and big black lashes, this may not be your go to. its still very black, but not Dior Blackout black. the mascara didn't do so good with layering with other mascaras. Ii tried to layer this over Buxom lash mascara which is great at separating, to make it waterproof and hold curl. it didn't really work out, just kind of weighed my lashes down. it may work with another base mascara. i have short asian lashes so the length and curl it adds as you can see in the pic is a big deal. my camera phone kinda sucks, its not doing the mascara justice! overall this is the best mascara I've tried, and I've tried a TON for my short stiff lashes. excuse the essay but really, i cant say enough good things about cannonball!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"This is my first pen eyeliner ever and I'm very satisfied with it. I love that it's a brush tip and not a felt tip so it will never fray, and the bristles feel so nice on my eyelids. The product is quite pigmented. You do have to shake it before you use it and the only things that bother me a bit are that sometimes the ink stops flowing and I have to swatch it on my hand a few times to get it going again and if you go over a line too much, the product kind of pulls itself up. The trick with this is just to work quickly so you don't have to drag over the dried liner too much. Overall, though, I'm just very glad I bought this one because of its applicator and its really black pigmentation. It's not 100% matte but its so black, you can't really tell. Lasts all day (unless you rub your eyes, which I don't do when I'm wearing makeup).

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I've read so much good review about this setting spray which is the reason I tried it but I was disappointed after trying it.
My PROs:
-- It's lightweight. It doesn't feel sticky or tight after it has dried on my skin.
-- It dries fast.
-- It doesn't drip down my face even though I tend to spray a little extra more all over.
-- I sprayed it on my lids (eyes closed and I sprayed it farther than the rest of my face) and it did not sting.
-- I didn't notice any funky smell to it...no scent
-- The spray applicator sprays pretty evenly to me.

My CONs:
-- Does not do a good job on keeping your makeup in place, especially not ""16 hours"" as it claims....so it defeats the purpose of a ""setting"" spray. Half way through the day, my makeup has somewhat faded. (I've used another setting spray that actually kept my makeup on all day even in summer hot weather & I'll be going back to this old one....fyi, sephora doesn't sell this one).
-- I bought and used it during winter time so if it doesn't hold up during winter time, I doubt it'll do a good job for the summery hot weather to come....but I'll see since I still have a lot left in the bottle by the time summer is here.…read more",21 03 2011,3 stars,It's ok...,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,-8.26E+18

diorshow spreads and defines my individual lashes like nothing else. its layering capabilities are la crème de la crème. as it sets throughout the day, the formula only turns more natural and beautiful--like a french woman, this mascara ages with grace.

it is less ""waterproof"" than drugstore brands, which took some getting used to. I now enjoy that removing mascara at night doesn't feel like tearing up asphalt.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"When I first wrote a review on UD's new Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara, I was pretty happy with it. I still am. I like how it coats, doesn't clump, and defines. In hot weather, we spend time on a boat. It gets windy sometimes and the water sometimes splashes in my eyes, causing other mascara to smudge a little. That doesn't happen with Cannonball. Because I find the wind to be drying to my eyes, on days that it's windy, I had been putting liquid lubricating drops in my eyes as a preventative. Those drops caused most waterproof mascara to run or smudge anywhere from a little to a lot, depending on the brand. I'm really impressed at how Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara wasn't bothered by the liquid drops. The one thing I do notice is that while this defines and coats really well, it's not adding too much volume to my long thick lashes like my regular mascara does, and I don't seem to see any lengthening either. I'm impressed at how well it defines my lashes, and stays in place until I remove it so I'm going to use it every time I'm for outdoor water activities. It doesn't disappoint.

Con:
-I only had the liner for a couple of weeks, and the liquid stopped flowing out of the pen after a few strokes! I have to continuously shake the pen and put some pressure on the tip to release more liquid -- which gets really annoying to do after ONLY a few strokes.

But eventually I wanted to wear foundation again so I picked it up to use it. I was so excited, and when it applied it to my face, it felt wonderful. My skin felt moisturized, but when I was finishing rubbing it into my face, it started balling up and PEELING OFF MY FACE!

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Although expensive, this mascara is definitely worth it. I have decently long natural eyelashes, and this definitely does the trick to take them to a whole other level. I've tried tons of other brands (mostly drugstore ones mind you), but so far nothing has come close to Dior. It goes on pretty easily and comes off easily too, which has been a problem for me with other brands in the past. It's waterproof and it wears all day, and it's buildable too. Two or three coats looks fantastic, but one light coat also keeps them long and volumized all day. They keep your lashes curled too, and there's no harsh, disgusting chemical smell which is a big plus.

This is a must-have if you're going to splurge, but I recommend when you're buying in store to open the product you're going to buy to make sure it isn't dry inside the bottle.

To compare, I get much better length and volume with my Clinique waterproof mascara and that usually is smudge-free for 12 hours if I use one coat.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I bought this primer after a Sephora employee suggested it to me. I didn't really know much about this primer besides seeing it on Youtube here and there. I opened it up when I got in the vehicle and tried it on the back of my hand. I have pretty dry skin and this seemed to have hydrated a decent amount, plus the scent was a pretty large bonus as well. So I had pretty high hopes.

However, when I tried it out for the first time, it seemed.. odd. I normally moisturize my skin prior to my makeup, and normally any hydrating primer just adds to it. This primer somehow had an opposite effect. It made my skin feel dryer and was very mattifying. Before I could even finish applying my foundation, I noticed that it was already beginning to separate and look cakey. Huge No Go. Took it off and scraped the bottom of my old primer. 

I tried it out a few more times after: with a different foundation, without/or different moisturizer, applying less product, testing it throughout the day, and just not trying to rage quit on the product in general. But it was all the same results. My skin looked extremely matte and cakey, my bronzer and contour now went on very patchy, the foundation and powder would settle in the fine lines under my eyes making me look older. Also after wearing it just a few times, I did manage to receive a small breakout.

I really wanted to love this primer. I enjoy the pump and tube packaging, as well as it smelled very delightful, and felt lightweight on the skin. It'll probably work better for those who have normal - dry skin or enjoy the matte look. But this primer is a pass for me.",21 07 2017,1 star,Sort of the Opposite/ Confusing,https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,3.98E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I bought this because I loved the idea of a ""gel with the convenience of a pencil""....

I have used to methods, apply it straight on the eye and then use a blending brush to blur out the jagged lines, or apply the product onto an eyeliner brush and then onto the eye. Don't get me wrong, in both cases I still get a beautiful finish, but it's no different than any other high end gel that comes in a pot.

If you're an eyeliner junkie in a ""gotta catch em all"" kinda way, then go for it.

I have to shake it multiple times during use or drag it across my hand to get it flowing again, only for it to dry up immediately.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"A few notes: I have sensitive eyes (allergies) that water terribly when they get irritated (which many eyeliners do). 

This eyeliner is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my eyes (even on my waterline) and stays on well through my allergy-related bouts of sneezing and teary eyes. 

Have realistic expectations: on my lash line, this product stays on for quite some time (an entire day's wear, easily). On the water line it will smudge out a little at the outer corners - you will still maintain some color on the waterline, however. So does it ""NEVER"" smudge? No. Does it stay remarkably well and not smudge terribly? Yes. 

It goes on smoothly and very vividly - no dragging along the lid. You can crank up the pencil (no sharpener necessary). You can smudge it out when you first apply it for a smoky eye effect, if that's how you do yours.

As someone who touches her eyelids subconsciously I don't have to worry about it flaking off. I have never really worn it an entire day but for the hours that I have, it never faded or chipped. Granted, I'm pretty sure my eyelids are quite dry. The only issue with this eyeliner is that it isn't waterproof AT ALL (which is sort of a big problem because waterproof is part of the product's name but whateva...) If you have oilier eyelids, are going out in the rain, or cry a lot, this is NOT the eyeliner for you.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have been a Sephora shopper for many years, and I spend a lot (too much) on makeup. I have never thought so highly of a product that I made time to write a review. This product is worth the time.

I have been looking for a truly long-wearing liquid eyeliner since high school. I've tried drug store brands and high-end lines; pretty much everything out there. All of the products either feathered, or flaked, or wore off, or had some other deficiency that made me continue my search.

Well, I'm done searching, because this stuff is really incredible. Not only does it not smudge off or flake, it looks as perfect 10 hours after you apply it as it did the moment you put it on.

We had a ridiculous snowstorm in NYC the other day, and I was stuck walking about 15 blocks into the wind. I was being pelted with snow, and my face was soaked. This eyeliner remained flawless. I couldn't believe it.

I am not the hugest Stila fan out there, but this product rocks. I'm never bothering with anything else.",22 02 2010,5 stars,INCREDIBLE,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,5.13E+18

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I am kind of astonished that this thing does what it says. I don't even really know how to describe how it feels when I spray it on - it's like it seeps through all the layers of my make up - highlighter, blush, bronzer, concealer, foundation - and fuses them together to form one layer of makeup that won't move. It also makes it look more natural and skin-like, if that makes sense; it removes the appearance of cakiness on my face. I also can't feel it once it dries, it's completely weightless.

I can't say it lowers the temperature of my makeup, and I haven't worn it in hot temperatures, but it's working during these frigid winter months and makes my makeup last all day. Will buy again and won't go a day without using it.",22 02 2014,5 stars,really does work,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,4.05E+18

It doesn't do the same job as a liquid liner (e.g., a perfect cat’s eye), but it is better than a regular pencil because the gel makes it go on smoother. I can't achieve a cat’s eye with this pencil because the tip isn’t sharp enough and the waterproofing is about 80% (lasts about 4-5 hours before it starts to transfer).

With just those reasons alone, I'd be happy with this eyeliner but this liner did something I never thought possible, it lasted 8+ hours in my waterline and still looked flawless.

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING stays put on my waterline for more then 2 hours without looking like a raccoon. I got to a point in life when I just accepted the fact that eyeliner will be running down the inner corner of my eyes throughout the day. I stopped fighting it lol.
The only eyeliner that does not run on me and turn me into a raccoon is Blacktrack Fluidline or Inglot #77 (I still love both) applied with a small thin brush on my waterline, or dipped with a regular eyeliner.

Until I found this......seriously the best eyeliner pencil on the market!",22 04 2015,5 stars,Found my holy grail!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-5.50E+17

So I don't use pencil liners for my eye lid, only liquid. So I like to put a line of eyeliner under my eyes. I've always had a problem with eyeliners smudging and not lasting and just looking horrible. So when I tried this I was shocked and so happy. IT DOESN'T BUDGE. One time I forgot to take off my makeup before I went to sleep, and when I woke up it was only smudged a tiny bit!! So I had been wearing it for at least 18 hours and it still looked so good!
One time when I got a custom makeover, they used one of the green shades under my eye (I forgot to ask which one) and it was so pretty!! And it worked just as well as black. I'm seriously going to try to get every color I want. I'll be broke but super happy xD

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"UD's All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray is more amazing than I originally thought. This is graduation week for one of our sons and it was put to the test. There's been lots of events, parties, and ceremonies all week. Many of the social events have been outdoors in the heat and humidity and then, rain. I'm so impressed by UD's All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray. During one of the outdoor parties, there was an unexpected torrential downpour. This spray performed better than expected. The rain was so heavy that our hair and clothes were plastered against our bodies. We were dripping wet with water running down our legs. Many of the people stayed to see if the sudden storm would quckly end. I was looking at some of the other moms who had smeared makeup all over their faces (particularly eye makeup on their cheeks). Myy husband surprised me by mentioning how great I looked. I assumed I looked as messy as everyone else. He said I looked like the women in those ocean photo shoots where the models' faces looks perfect, even though they've supposedly just come out of the water after swimming. I actually didn't get the full impact of his comment until an hour later when I saw myself in the mirror. Many of us ended up dancing in the rain which was incredibly romantic. The thing that surprised me at the time was the realization that no makeup product rubbed off on his white shirt when I rested my head against him so I incorrectly assumed all my eye makeup and blush had washed away from the rain. When I finally did see myself in the mirror, all my makeup (eye makeup, blush, tinted moisturizer) was pretty much intact with no big mess. (Some of it was waterproof but not all was).

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"Please read through for a detailed, thoughtful review of my personal experience. I have been using this spray, the older white bottle version and it seems to work on and off. When I spray it on top of the liquid foundation, (including powder, contour powder highlight blush and everything), it seems to cause my make up to cake up. At first I thought it was my other products, like a cakey foundation with a bad formula, or a cakey powder that is not milled too fine, but it kept happening over and over again. I am the kind of person who has switches up and tries different foundations (but I do give my skin a few days on one product to get used to it etc.) and I do not spray too much setting spray like beauty Gurus who like to shower in it. So for UD spray to cause me this cakiness within a few hours of start wear time, I am not satisfied with it as a setting spray. So I am keeping the bottles I have and will try to use with light make up application and to wet brushes, I just won't use on top of everything. Finally, I would say this product does not work for the purpose it is made for and does not do what it claims, but I could use it in different ways.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I'm constantly looking for the perfect mascara to help my stick straight lashes. I've tried Nars, Clinique, Benefit, Lancome, MAC, and even Maybelline without being completely wowed. I finally picked up the Diorshow and realized why it is a top seller. The mascara gives my lashes volume and a bit of length and helps keep a curl in my lashes. This is one of the few mascaras I've tried that allows me to put on multiple coats (even with minutes in between) and still has a smooth application. I haven't had a single issue with clumping or flaking. This is worth a try and definitely worth the money.",22 07 2011,5 stars,Nicest mascara I've ever purchased,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,5.43E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I wrote a review for this when I started using this eyeliner about a year ago, because it had been by far the best liner I'd used. It's a tad expensive ($18) and when I ran out, I decided to try a more affordable option and bought Sephora's Doe Eyed Felt Eyeliner ($12). Sephora's was all right, but it didn't go on quite as smoothly or easily as Kat's. I felt like it was more difficult to create the exact line I wanted than it was with Kat's. I used it for a little while, but decided it wasn't quite cutting it for me.

I decided to return the Sephora brand eyeliner and get Kat's again, and once I started using it again I couldn't believe I ever left it! It was like I had gotten an old friend back, lol. Which is why I'm writing this review now. I discovered that the big difference is the brush. Most liner pens (like the Sephora one I tried) are a solid felt tip - Kat's is the only one with an actual BRUSH, which creates an infinitely more precise application. It allows you to easily create any thickness of line you want. I cannot recommend this product enough. After leaving this product and coming back to it, I don't think I could ever leave it again!…read more",22 07 2011,5 stars,Will never go back to anything else!,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,1.86E+18

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I bought this eyeliner in White.

The product dries quickly but if you're not satisfied with the coverage and try to go in with some more, it can become a bit cakey, or slightly ""crusty"".

The top doesn't stay pointed for long and the sharpener is a nightmare to use (top broke off more than once in it!). I am not sure if this formula is sensitive to room temperature, but it was warm in the store and under bright lights but cooler in my home (late September in Canada) which may explain the difference in formulas between the tester and the one I bought.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,This eyeliner was recommended to me by a staff instore and I agreed it's a good one after trying. The gel texture makes it really easy to apply even for beginners like me. I also like the built-in sharpener. But after using for a few times I realize it's not very friendly to oily skin. It smudges after ~3 hours around the eyelids and outer corners of the eyes even if I carefully applied primer and setting power around the area. I also tried to blend it util it's a really thin layer and it helped reduce the smudging a little bit. So probably it's not enough to just draw the lines and let it set since it smudges easily if there is a lot of product.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I love this eyeliner (especially when I can actually get it onto my lids in a straight line). Stays right where you put it and lasts all day. The applicator brush is especially nice - it doesn't catch on the skin or change shape if you use it every day.

The formula does tend to pucker a little if you slap it on too thickly, but who's going to get that close to your face to be able to tell? Not that it doesn't EVER happen... Whatever, I don't know your life so I don't judge. :)

You'll have to go over your liner if you're putting it on top of a shiny eye shadow - the pigment doesn't stay true otherwise. And shake well before using or you'll get that runny oil coming out on your lids before the pigment starts flowing. You know when you pour out ketchup without shaking it first?

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"Product: Urban Decay Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray (29.00 for 4.0 fluid ounces)
Shade: Clear

>> I didn't expect much when I got this, especially because I've never tried setting sprays before. Urban Decay claimed a lot of things about this, and usually I don't list what the company says, but just take a look...

>> What it does: It's the new final step to your makeup routine! This weightless, super-fine mist holds foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and concealer in place so that makeup looks picture-perfect all day long. Temperature Control Technology prevents makeup from a melt down when it's warm and avoids makeup dehydration and cracking when it's cold. All Nighter works expertly on all skin types and prevents loss of color, melting, sliding, caking, cracking, excess shininess, fading blush, eyeshadow, and lip color disappearance. AND it's formulated to resist moisture, so you can fearlessly sweat, cry, or get your Jacuzzi on—you're guaranteed makeup that always looks just-applied, without ever feeling sticky or tight. Backed by years of science, All Nighter is simply unlike any other product available and keeps you looking flawless with just a couple sprays on top of your makeup.

>> What else you need to know: All Nighter is allergy tested, dermatologist tested, vegan, cruelty free, and free of oil, parabens, and fragrance.

>> Research Results: 81.8% of customers say product gave makeup a healthy glow. 78.8% of customers said product helped makeup avoid creasing. 75.7% of customers said makeup looked as good at end of the day as at the beginning of the day.

>> Wow. A spray that is lightweight, super-fine, sets eye makeup, sets face makeup, sets lip makeup, uses temperature control technology, works on all skintypes, prevents de-pigmentation, prevents melting, prevents sliding, prevents caking, prevents cracking, prevents shine, prevents fading, prevents creasing, resists moisture, gives a healthy glow, and makes makeup look the same at the end of the day.

>> Um... is it just me or is that a TON to offer! After reading that mouthful I was very skeptical of this product. Was Urban Decay just ""fluffing"" up the description. I was wrong. This spray really does all of that, I really wish I could just give this an A++++++++ to the millionth power. I was so surprised at how awesome this stuff is, anyways into the in-depth review.

>> This spray is created by Urban Decay but uses formulations from Skindinanvia, or a brand that specifically creates setting sprays. I received this in a small bottle and followed the instruction by simply shaking and then spraying on the face. I like to make sure that everything is always even, so even though the bottle says spray 2-4 times I might of sprayed 5-8 times very lightly to make sure my whole face was covered. When I was spraying this on I thought it would feel very sticky or gooey on the face, or basically uncomfortable. Instead it felt like I was misting very ""finely milled... water"" on my face. The spray is very thin and feels as light as air on the face, as if you're running through a park in the early morning. Just a fine amount of dew on the face, very refreshing. The spray takes about 10-15 seconds to dry depending on how much you applied. So, overall the application was easy and the spray felt very refreshing. I noticed a slight 'sugary' fragrance, even though this is fragrance free; so maybe it's my imagination. Overall it just smells (not a bad thing) just when spraying; but the all of the scent disappears after it dries.

>> Just to make it clear, I've seen people on Youtube spray this before applying makeup. According to the bottle you spray it on AFTER you apply makeup, so make sure you use it after makeup application. It will not work as well if you apply it beforehand because you are simply ""setting"" your natural skin. If you do have dry or oily skin setting beforehand can help makeup application go on easier though.

>> Now here came the true test, to see if my makeup stayed on all day and really did the things that Urban Decay listed it did. After a 14 hour day, none of my makeup had changed. (Urban Decay claimed that this stuff works for 16 hours, and I believe them.) My makeup looked exactly the same. Obviously this didn't do anything for my tightline because the spray can't magically fly into my eye and along the inner rims. All my eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, concealer, tinted moisturizer, blush, highlighter, lip stain, etc. seemed to have stayed in-tact. It literally looked the same as it did when I had applied it in the morning. For temperature control these past weeks have been relatively cold because of winter. I didn't notice any flaking at all (score!), since I have dry skin this was surprising. (I was thinking of buying the version for dry skin, know as Dew Me, but this works fine. They also have a version for oily skin known as De-Slick.) I did test this out when I went out on a jog, and I noticed that my makeup didn't melt off and my skin didn't feel uncomfortable, (score again!).

>> I can definitely see how this works on all skin types. I have slight combination skin meaning half of the time my skin can be normal. (No oil, no dry patches) While other times I can have lots of oil and blocked pores in my T-Zone, or forehead, nose, and chin. I will also have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nose also. This didn't disturb my skin type by making me any oilier or any drier, which is nice to know. If you have severely oily or severely dry skin I recommend trying out Dew Me or De-Slick, which are the same things but are formulated for certain skin types. I noticed that it did prevent all the things above, de-pigmentation (fading), melting, sliding, caking, cracking, creasing, bla bla bla. My makeup did look the same as it did in the morning and my skin had a soft healthy glow, something like a lit from within appearance. As you can see this setting spray is amazing and I apply it on to all of my makeup looks that I wear outside.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I feel like I need to give a second review on this mascara. I have a love/hate relationship with it. One the ""pro"" side, this mascara is truly ULTRA waterproof, it stays put through swimming, sweating, anything. I live in southern Italy where it is hot and balmy all summer and this mascara is my staple. On the ""con"", very annoying side; this mascara is filled with tiny hair-like fibers that flake off into your eyes though the day. This is especially problematic when you are sweating these fibers into your eyes at the gym forcing you to interrupt your routine to get the hairs out of your eye. What a pain! The mascara itself will stay put through anything, but those fibers have got to go. I have been on the search for another waterproof mascara that works as well as this, to no avail. So I will probably suck it up with the fibers and continue to have beautiful lashes with Cannonball through this next sweaty Italian summer.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I honestly was a bit shaky about the price at first. Although I've heard great reviews of the product. I decided to get the travel size one for $10-$12. I instantly fell in love with the product. I literally was so scared when the travel size was running low. Its that of a great product. I needed it! I recently just started working in a restaurant. I'm constantly running around and literally have no time to go in the restroom to check up on my make up. I also couldn't afford to have my make up falling apart. When I got this product. It did wonders for me. I saved so much time and money. I don't ever have to retouch my make up meaning I use less of my products.

How I use the all nighter spray with my make up routine:
-I moisturize and use the UD facial primer in brightening
-My Makeup Forever HD foundation
-Laura Mercier concealer in 2
-Mac loose mineral Powder
* I spray the all nighter two times 8 inches away (let it set and dry)
-Then I prime my lids with UD original primer
- My Naked Platte 1
- Prime my lashes with Too Face lash primer
- Water proof Mascara
-Brows
-Contour
-Blush

However, recently UD revamped the bottle, and apparently the formula too?! While the stuff still works, it has his HORRID smell -- like musty plastic (if that's even a thing).

My eyelids get stuck open and it makes it hard to blink. I don't have naturally ""sticky"" eyelids, and I've never had this problem with any other liner, so there must just be something in the formula that my body reacts to.

If you sweat, you'll feel the moisture build up under this product, which is a rather strange sensation.

In general it does most of what it promises, doesn't irritate skin, and doesn't break you out, which is all you could realistically hope for.

I have had the best luck with Urban Decay's liners. They last long and don't wear off as easily as other brands. I have tried liquid and gel liners, which have the staying power I want but never had the best luck applying them.

This product is amazing! It lasts for awhile (wore it for about 9hrs), even while outside in the sun. It was a little runny at the end of the day but hardly noticeable. Sometimes I look like I have a bruised eye with all the running some of my other liners have done.

What's great is that it's a convenient crayon/pencil, but has the lasting power and intensity of a gel liner. It definitely isn't smudgable, unless you're some make-up pro who can figure it out over this amateur.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,This spray is absolutely amazing! I have been using it every day to keep my BB cream and powder in place and it stays all day.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I literally just took a 4 hour nap and ladies, we all know when we sleep with our make up on, it ends up on our pillows, blanket, sheets, etc: not cute. But I woke up and there weren't any stains whatsoever, which was quite surprising. I even checked the mirror and I kid you not, it looked like I just applied it this morning. I'm pretty sure this is sweat-proof too. I always speed walk to class (cause I take my sweet little time meticulously putting my make up on, as we are all familiar with the ritual) and end up drenched in sweat - I looked like I just ran a marathon. Thankfully, this spray holds my make up together and it prevents those heinous sweat streaks on my face from all the sweat dripping down from my forehead. So if it lasts through sleep and sweat, you gotta add this to your daily make up routine! I guess they don't call it *all nighter* for nothing, if you know what I mean ;) I also have a five page essay due tomorrow, so I'm basically pulling an all nighter myself. Maybe Urban Decay created this setting spray specifically for students like me that pull all nighters because they leave their assignments/studying till the last minute, procrastinate by writing a detailed Sephora review, and yet still want to look cute through all the suffering they're putting themselves through?

I've always just blended a little eyeshadow on my lower lash line if I wanted the effect.

I am SO impressed with this eyeliner! The marker-like tip is genius -- you could honestly draw a mural on your face with it. I was skeptical at first of the whole Kat Von D line; I thought it was maybe just gimicky. But after buying the liquid lipstick, purple sparkly nail polish, &amp; now this, I'm convinced that these are some of the most innovative products out there!

There is only one problem with this eyeliner: if I don't let it dry enough, it will start sticking to the skin just above my eyelid crease, which is not only annoying but leads to smudging.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I have the liner in both Jazz and Blacquer.
Jazz is the most amazing color. I can't even describe how pretty it is. I line my eyes with it when I don't feel like putting eyeshadow on, and it looks very natural despite the purple color. It's creamy and glides on like a dream. I literally slide it once on my eye and I'm done.
Blacquer is very very black, and it is just as creamy as Jazz. It dries differently though. I don't really know how to explain it... I have ""monolids,"" so I need a fairly thick line for it to look like I have anything on. The first time I used it, I let it dry completely before opening my eye in case it smudged. When I opened my eye, it kind of made a crease(?). It doesn't bother me but I just think it's interesting that it does that. If you don't know what a monolid is you can totally ignore that because it won't happen to you. One thing that I don't like about blacquer is that when I have my eyelashes curled and it gets on my lashes, it clumps them together and sometimes they stick to my lid as I apply the liner.
Both of these don't budge after they dry. Rain, sweat, and humidity don't affect these liners. I can rub my eyes without worrying about smudging. However, it comes off quite easily with remover wipes, so no furious scrubbing needed. If you need a sharp tip for thin lines, just use the sharpener to get it pointy again!
All the colors are beautiful, and they are worth the money. I especially recommend Jazz.…read more",23 11 2013,5 stars,Jazz and Blacquer,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-2.13E+18

It is very saturated and it would stay on you forever until you wash it off. It is very creamy, a little too creamy though because it's a little hard to apply. The tip isn't very sharp too, so it's harder to control, and it is very hard to me to make sharp thin lines. If you mess up, you better clean it up RIGHT AWAY, if not you would have to take it off with a make up remover. Overall, I love the product, even though I have to spend more time putting it on.

Also when storing this product if you store it upside down 1. The product lasts a lot longer and 2. You don't get the dry out from one eye to the next that some complain about. If you find that when you get to close to the year duct it's smudging into the eye or around that means you are getting to close and you may have over active tear ducks cause let me tell you this stuff

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,,24 01 2015,3 stars,"Alright, here is my review. I gave this eyeliner three stars because there are things I love and things I hate. Here goes. First, I have the color Blacquer and it is gorgeous. It's very pigmented and dark. It also does not budge, which is something I look for and love in an eyeliner. It is more of a matte eyeliner and not shiny, which again, is a plus for me. It also works amazingly on the water line and for tightlining. However, the tip is rounded and not sharp. It does come with a built-in sharpener, but I don't find it very helpful. If you're looking for a thin, precise line I would not recommend this liner. For me, because of the rounded tip I get much more of a thick line and I don't always want that. It does go on very smoothly, but it can also be messy (if that makes sense). You can make or break your look quite easily. Upon applying I find that the liner does fake for me. It has gotten into my eyes, and as a contact wearer it is a big hassle. I want to love this liner, but I have a few reservations.

It goes on light, dries super fast, and even if you don't use the De-slick version, it keeps your face dry. And most importantly, your makeup will not budge. It is my go-to for any event, especially weddings. You only need about 3-4 spritzes and you're good to go.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I purchased this product looking for a better liquid liner than I've been using. It was recommended by one of the Sephora girls in my local store.
THIS PRODUCT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY!
The color looks like it's watered-down. No where close to applying black; more like gray. The tip dries out extremely fast when applying. I have to put the cap back on & wait for five minutes before continuing. Then, once I'm done applying & allowing it to dry, it sticks on my upper eye lids & smudges. Also... waterproof, my a**! I've never had a liner come off so easily when the tiniest bit of water touches it!

Before this product I was using a L'Oéal moisturizer under my makeup and it was nice but a bit too heavy. When I saw this I figured I would give it a shot. I LOVE IT! Now, I would not recommend this product as a PORE primer, but it definitely is a face primer. It nicely preps my skin before I apply my makeup. I don't have too many trouble pores but on days I want to conceal them, I use this product along with the smash box pore minimizer, and together... flawless!! The smell is basically the ingredients.. coconut water. I didn't love the smell at first but now I do because it just replenishes my face! I will even use this product on days when I don't wear any makeup. Overall, its for sure worth a try!

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I only use waterproof mascara, otherwise I end up with raccoon eyes by mid day. They changed the formula of the mascara I've used for years so have been on the hunt for a new one for months. I've wasted so much money. Finally found one I love! I was suspicious of the small, thin brush but after about the third use, it gave my lashes awesome length and definition. Not much volume but it's just a fact you have to sacrifice volume for waterproof. Dries quickly and my lashes are still soft and natural! NO crunchy, flaky lashes! Maybe because of the gel formula? Only con is waterproof works too well. Hard to remove, even with makeup remover. But I'd rather spend extra time taking it off at night than wiping mascara from under my eyes all day.

So, let me just be the first to say that Marc Jacobs Beauty is one of my all time favorite brands, which is unfortunate --- because it can get really expensive.  That being said, I am constantly impressed by the products delivered.

The Highliner matte gel crayons are utter perfection.  Influenster sent me the shades (Earth)quake and (Over)night, which were absolutely perfect choices for my brown eyes.  

The quality of these pencils are fantastic.  The pigment is very good, and they are incredibly long-lasting in the waterline.  If you're swatching in store --- be aware that the colors will stay on your hand forever!  ;)

Two main issues:

1) This really was not highly pigmented. My eyeliner was not coming out dark at all, especially over eyeshadow. It also doesn't seem to layer at all when I try to put more eyeliner on to counter this.

2) It dries out so quickly! I bought this TWICE, because the first time it dried out pretty quick. I figured maybe I just got a lemon, but the second eyeliner had the above problem and dried out within a month too.

I had been using the NARS primer which was not bad, held the oil at bay for 4 hours which was great for my eye shape. I tried the UD with a matte smoky eye, and it was seriously a dream come true!!

Using the appropriate shadow is just as important I believe. I know some didn't think the primer was doing the job, but keep in mind that using a mineral shadow on an oily lid is usually not likely to stay. Also, do ONE lid at a time. If you put primer on both lids, one will be completely dry by the time you get to it. I should not be wet, but a little bit tacky to lock in the powder.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've been using liquid eyeliner for about 16 years. Throughout that decade and a half plus I've used every brand of liquid liner I could get my hands on. Most of them were either too runny, had a bogus brush, wore off in a minute or pulled at my eye skin. Then I found this...

The brush PERFECT because it's thick and sturdy yet has a fine point for a well defined cat eye. You can get a really deep, dark line with a clean edge.

It's also no joke when it comes to staying power. I've put it on, gone out and danced my rear off all night, fell asleep and it was still perfect the next morning. Or, let's be honest here, the next afternoon.

But just because it's great and long lasting doesn't mean you have to tear your eyelids off to get rid of it either. A little bit off eye makeup remover does the trick.

Finally, the price. I'm all about getting the most for my money and you definitely do with this liner. At $18 it's a steal because it lasted me a good 6 months and I wear it at least 4 times a week, probably more.

The Kat Von D Tattoo Liner is hands down the best liquid eye liner I have ever used and I will be absolutely heartbroken if this ever gets discontinued.…read more",24 07 2010,5 stars,Kat Von D Tattoo Liner is perfect!,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,1.37E+18

I tell them its taken me years but with this product, this could be your first time with eyeliner application and it will come as close to perfection as you can get.

The shape and felt tip make it so effortlessly to apply. It basically feels like your just holding a normal pen and it only applies where you want it to. The tip helps you control the thickness of your lines.

Does not smudge or crease. Anything I apply to my eyes has a great risk of creasing because of my small eyelid, but it stays in place all day through anything. I work in an environment where water splashes are common as well as hot steam, and it does not move.

This product is very long lasting. I usually have to buy a new liner every 3 to 4 weeks because I use it a lot. I wear this eyeliner 6 out of 7 days.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,,24 09 2016,4 stars,"I've used this eyeshadow primer for a couple months and have found that it's pretty good at stopping any smearing or creasing of the eyeshadow. I don't think it works as a color corrector very well, but maybe that's because I have major discoloration around my eyes and I would need something more heavy-duty to take care of that. You have to put it on really quickly and evenly or else it clumps strangely, especially at the inner corner of the eye. It's really easy to overdo it, so I put some of the cream on the back of my hand and use a concealer brush to put it on. Once I begin with the eyeshadow, I have to blend really quickly or else the colors will lock in place too early. I also found it to be really drying, so I use olive oil to remove all my makeup and then use Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil to dry to replenish moisture. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for an eyeshadow primer that holds color without creasing or smearing, but not for color correcting or those who have really sensitive skin around their eyes.",https://www.sephora.com/product/eyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716?icid2=products%20grid:p284716,-3.92E+18

Pros: Super waterproof Fibers add length (but flakes off during wear) Smudge-proof (with primer) Cons: Formula degrades over time fairly quickly (within 2 months) Does not keep lash curl after formula degrades By the end of my 3 month stint with this tube, it'd look fantastic on for the first 10 minutes, and 2 hours later I find my lashes have lost most of its curl and drooped back down. I only apply mascara at the base of my lashes during the day, so I know it's not because it's weighing my lashes down. Sad to say but my CoverGirl Lash Exact holds better lash curl than this at the end of using it for 3 months. 4 stars for being amazing the first 2 months.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I am not going to lie but after I purchased this eyeliner and got home to try it, I tossed away all of my drug store eyeliners because this one has done EVERYTHING I wanted an eyeliner to do. The problem for me with most eyeliners is that they all smudge underneath my eyes. I tried every one in the drugstore, I tried the ""glorified"" one by Jane Cosmetics, I tried other highend brands and they just all failed. Maybe it's just my eyes?
So I was sckeptical about this $25 eyeliner and thought that if this fails me as well, I'll just return it back to Sephora. And of my gosh, it is amazing. First of all, it is very very pigmented and it feels like a thicker gel eyeliner that usually comes in a jar (think Bobbie Brown), but it's in a pencil form and is much more comfortable to apply and blend. Once this sets it DOES NOT MOVE. Anywhere! Even in the waterline it stays put for hours and hours. I personally don't mind spending that kind of money on an excellent products that delivers, so I will definitely save up and buy it again.",24 10 2013,5 stars,Where have this been all my life!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,-8.78E+18

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've always shied away from liquid eyeliners, because I have very shaky hands and I feared I would look like a Picasso work with lines all across my face...I have always used Dior's crayon eyeliner and while I absolutely love it, we all know crayons have a different effect than liquid eyeliners.

So I read reviews and decided to try this and I absolutely love it! The brush tip is neither too soft nor too hard and makes application easy-peasy. And even if I mess up a bit, it's so thin, I can easily correct it that my final line is straight, yet not too thick. It is seriously so thin you can make the thinnest line imaginable or build it up for a thicker, bolder look.

I read that other reviewers wrote that they had problems with this drying out after a short period of time and I disagree. I've had this eyeliner since April (it's end of October now) and my Tattoo Liner is still going strong.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I LOVE this mascara! I have it in both the blue and the black. I have thin lashes that are straight as a pin, but this makes it look like I'm wearing false lashes without the falsies! I used to live in a humid climate and was looking for a way to get my mascara to last through the day in the heat - this does that! No smearing, dripping, glopping, clumping, or anything! But you need to take care to not pump the brush in and out of the tube to get more product because that will clump the mascara (just like any other mascara, really). A swirl inside the tube will do the trick and won't clump or dry out the product. One tube lasted me months. I wouldn't actually go swimming with it on because it *will* smear, and since it's ""waterproof,"" removal without makeup remover at the pool/beach will be near impossible. Oddly enough, I've cried with it on and the only think that happened was that my lashes came out straight afterward - no raccoon eyes! Also, the blue is AMAZING!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I bought this to replace my old Stila liquid liner (the tip stopped getting ink flow). I wanted a cheapter alternative to the Stila liner, and one that didn't have a nylon sheen like the Stila. The sheen made the eyeliner look ill-applied where the light would reflect on it, making it look slimmer in that area.

THE GOOD
Perfectly matte; looks great
Does not rub off easily
Doesn't melt off face (Dior crayon WILL melt off face)
Beautiful lines can be created with the precision tip
Good price for quality of product

THE BAD
Doesn't like moisture (hair grease from bangs, sweat of any kind, tears...)
Doesn't come off as easily as other make up, even with remover
Doesn't layer well (with itself--once it dries, it won't glide well over itself. Not so good when missed a spot)

So, if you want an alternative to Stila's liner, this is an acceptable replacement. You will just need to work quickly.…read more",24 11 2013,4 stars,Good outweighs Bad,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-5.48E+18

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I have been using Urban Decay primer potion for over 6 years. My eyeshadow never creases with it on and it is a very lightweight, and smooth formula. Although I like their other primer potions (ie. Sin), you can't go wrong with the original. I recently bought the smaller tube from Sephora for $12 which in my opinion is a steal.

I tried and tried and tried but no eyeliner could truly make the line as thin as I wanted it... until tattoo liner. Oh my gosh. You can get so much precision with this tip. I would draw it on so you COULD NOT EVEN SEE THE LINE! And it would still be super pigmented AND stay for the whole day. Over the years I've continued to use it, and no matter how thick or thin or sharp or whatever my liner is, Tattoo Liner always comes through. Actually incredible.

But I didn't just chill in the sand like most girls do. I went JETSKIING. And IT STAYED ON!!!! All of my makeup! Even my eyelashes(but I'm sure that was just the glue haha) But seriously guys. I was expecting it to be totally gone like how it normally would when you get in the ocean and get saltwater sprayed all up in your eyes nose and mouth, but this made it all stay and I was still able to take cute pics later in the day because MY MAKEUP STAYED THE ENTIRE TIME!!!!

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I was not a fan of liquid eyeliners because they tend to be shining and hard to make changes.
As I live in *very* dry city, I didn't have to worry about sweating and humidity (and many more concerns when you live in the city that is humid).
And this year, I traveled to Atlanta, Miami, and DC - I knew I was going to take a lot of pictures so I wanted to be prepared.
After reading reviews after reviews, I chose this, and I am so glad that I did!

1. This doesn't shine (which I learned that many of liquid eyeliners are)
2. It stays longer (even if you cry or rub your eyes accidentally)
3. You don't have to try really hard to take this off (as long as you have lip and eye remover, you are fine)
4. The brush tip is hard enough (so you have better control when drawing lines)

I bought the black one (Trooper), and I am definitely going to try other colors. Highly recommended!!!!!…read more",25 08 2013,5 stars,Oh my god!!,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-8.36E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I used beauty points for this and I am very pleased with my decision. I've always been afraid to use liquid eyeliner and this is my first. I don't like dramatic eyes for work and because the tip is so this I was able to make the lines super thin without skipping like I get from pencils. I also have oily lids which is why I gave up on pencils. I've tried Makeup Forever and Stila pencils and I had raccoon eyes after two hours. With this, after a whole day (7hrs) outside in the heat and humidity, the liner never budged (even though my face was an oily mess). I was disappointed that the brown was discontinued so I decided to experiment with a drugstore liquid liner (Loreal Telescopic Precision waterproof liquid) and it was so thick and goopy and flaked off like mascara after a few hours. I didn't even go outside! So although, I still might be annoyed about the lack of brown, I'll be buying a full size of the Tattoo Liner. I'm sold and don't want to experiment any more!…read more",25 08 2013,5 stars,So easy to use and lasts,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,6.60E+18

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I was caught in a summer downpour in Atlanta in July. The rain was cascading down my face. I ran inside and straight to the bathroom mirror to see the eyeliner disaster. To my surprise, my eyeliner was perfect. No streaks, no running. It was a miracle. Granted, I avoided touching my eyes at all during the rain because I thought it would make things worse. So don't touch and you'll be fine.

I've tried Lorac, Lancôme, 24 hr., Shiseido, Chanel, and Shu Uemura. This is the best for its sharpness, dark black pigment, and staying power. Lorac is very fine but not as pigmented. Lancôme is better for dry lids. Shiseido and Chanel are dark and thick but they flake off. (My husband asked me why my eyeliner line just stopped. It had flaked off. )

The tip is between a brush and a felt tip. You just shake it before you open it. I feel it goes on evenly and always me to touch it up or go over lines without it flaking.

I bought an extra Stila so that I won't ever be without one. I'm not sure how long it will last but this is it for me.",25 08 2014,5 stars,Very waterproof,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,2.20E+18
Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I was in need of a good liquid liner for my daily thick wings, and asked my SA for recommendations for a matte, opaque product. Like many others I'd heard great things about this liner so it seemed like a safe bet. Unfortunately the hype worked to my disadvantage, as I expected more from this liner than it really could deliver.

All things considered it's not a bad product, but opaque and matte it is not. I used it on bare lids as well as over UDPP and UDPP/shadow. Every time it had a glossy finish and needed a couple of passes to be truly opaque. Strangely enough it's easy to get opacity from swatching but it streaked on the eyelid itself.

The wearability is acceptable but didn't really fall into the ""stay all day"" category for me; on my non-oily lids I could get about 10 hours of wear before it looked faded and patchy. Set with shadow, the liner lasted 12-14 hours with reasonable coverage. Application was easy, although the felt tip began to disintegrate by my 5th or 6th use.

This is a decent product for some uses. It would be good for subtle or natural looks and I hear that the colored versions of this liner are exceptional. You can get some respectable weartime after setting with a shadow, but for this price point that's a bit disappointing. For dramatic or matte looks there are other products that perform much better.",25 08 2014,3 stars,Be sure to manage your expectations.,https://www.sephora.com/product/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818?icid2=products%20grid:p253818,-5.99E+18

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"This eyeliner actually stays put all day and all night. I never have to reapply. The only time it smudges is when I first put it on + my face primer is still moist and if I blink my eyes a bunch...but it'll wipe right off of my eyelids when this does happen. After that, I'm set until I wash my face. It comes off easily with eye makeup remover. 

The crayon is never ""sharp"" but it still glides on in a pretty small line, so it's fine. 

My only complaint is if I wait too long to put on my mascara after putting on this eyeliner. Sometimes it makes my eyelashes feel stiff at the base. However, it doesn't make my mascara clumpy or anything like that, so it's really not much of a complaint.

I am TERRIBLE at putting on eyeliner. This is a breeze to use! I will definitely buy it again.",25 08 2016,4 stars,Love it,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,2.24E+17

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"As someone who comes from a cosmetic background I hope this feedback finds its way to someone who can make changes to the product because it does have huge potential. The formula is great it is long wearing and it is very very black (I did a quick comparison in store to other high and low end brands few compared). The downsides are that it doesn't last very long--mine lasted for just 1 month. The short life can probably be associated with the second problem, the formula is way too soft for this package. I found myself constantly 'sharpening' and at no point was I ever able to get the pencil to in fact be a pencil point despite using the sharpening tool. It seems like this particular eyeliner needs to be repackaged and/or be put into a pot.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've never written a review on here, but this deserves one.

Let me preface this with the fact that I'm Asian, have slightly hooded eyelids, which are pretty oily --- absolutely nothing can stay on them. I don't care how waterproof something says it is, nothing will stay on. My eyes are just difficult. From mascara, to eyeshadow, to liner --- everything comes off in about two (2) hours and I look like a raccoon.

My method: No matter what, I always prep with Urban Decay, and then do a sealing with a neutral eyeshadow over any liner and things will stay on for six (6) hours max.

Before this, I was using the Stilia waterproof liner (which I will also sing accolades about because it was my HG for a while before I found this one). It was almost perfect, but was just slightly not as great.

Found that this one had a similar application tip and tried it on a whim because it was called the Tattoo liner --- I was pretty skeptical because I didn't know if I thought a reality star could have a fab makeup line, but the staying power for this is great.

I definitely still need to do all the steps from prime to sealing with eyeshadow, but with those steps I can basically sleep in this and it'll stay 90% on. The 10% that does come off is fading, and does not cause the raccoon effect.

ALSO, this is freakin' foolproof!!!!! I love makeup, but my technique is lousy at best. But with the ease and glide of this liner, I can almost always make the perfect cat-eye line. Start from the outside and fill-in!

The pigmentation is just NOT there. It goes on almost a charcoal gray rather than black, and you have to trace over it SEVERAL times to get a nice line or a wing.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Eyeliner can be a hassle, whether it is for work, school, or a night out. However, Kat Von D’s Tattoo Liner in Trooper is perfect for regular use especially if you are constantly busy, and need something long lasting that will not be harsh on your eyes.

The pen itself has a soft, narrow brush that is perfect for creating thin, buildable lines. Many liners with similar brushes dry out extremely fast, but not Trooper. My liner has lasted me months, and I will definitely repurchase it when the formula does run out.

The formula is so long lasting. You could put this on at 6 am before work or school, and it would last you all day. And if you want to go out with friends or family afterwards and want a more dramatic look Trooper builds beautifully. You won’t have to worry about the liner from flaking off as you thicken your look.

And if you’re nervous about applying liquid linear, don’t be; Trooper can be used by beginners and pros. For only $19 dollars, Trooper is an affordable high end product that creates great looks with ease due to its high pigmentation, and precise applicator. Plus it dries instantaneously; it won’t ever smudge like an ordinary pencil liner or drip into your eyes.

Despite Trooper’s staying power, it is so simple to remove. No need to rub your eyes raw with harsh make up remover. Trooper comes off with a simple wipe of micellar water and a cotton pad.

Hope you enjoy it and much as I have!",25 09 2015,5 stars,The Eyeliner That Meets All Your Beauty Needs,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-8.14E+18

I even use it on the outer edges of my lips, to prevent the lipstick from bleeding, and trust me - I sometimes work 12h shifts with mandatory red lipstick as part of the grooming and its the best thing ever - the red does not bleed (which I used to hate, before finding UDPP, as it looked messy) and it stays put for many hours without the need to replenish.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I have only tried this product in Trooper (black). This liner is great - it has great opacity, is very waterproof, has a great applicator that allows for high precision, and doesn't smudge. For any of the previous comments to be true, it is VITAL to let it dry first; if, for example, your eyes are sensitive and tend to tear up when you're applying makeup, the tears might make it smudge away if it still isn't dry. It's got plastic bristles on the applicator, which is great for precision, as opposed to the sponge ones. The only complaint I have about this liner (and the reason I gave it 4stars) is because it tends to dry out temporarily which makes it difficult and frustrating to apply, and the product tends to dry and build up near the base of the applicator. Store it tip down to prevent this from happening, and clean the applicator every so often.…read more",25 11 2010,4 stars,"Great product, minor issues..",https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-1.06E+18

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"This is my second tube of this mascara and I LOVE it! I have pretty pale coloring, but my hair has started getting more dirty-blonde as I get older and I've found that black mascara (as opposed to brown or dark brown) just makes my features pop a little more and looks cleaner. This mascara defines lashes while lenthening them without making lashes look too ""done"" - no spider lashes or clumps.

I was also looking explicitly for a waterproof mascara when i tried this. For whatever reason, mascaras always tend to smear under my eyes (even many waterproof formulas) but this stays put all day and only requires a little makeup remover or soap in the shower to come off. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.

The pump is very well made that when you spray the product the mist applies on to your face very evenly and light. Before the product came out, I was using the Make Up Forever Mist &amp; Fix. The Mix &amp; Fix was nice too but when you spray the mist it does not feel as light or even. However the Mist &amp; Fix has a travel size bottle, I'm hoping that Urban will come out with one too so it's easy to bring it around when I go out. What I do is when i'm done with the travel size bottle of Make Up Forever I pour Urban's spray into it but again the pump is not that great.

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I felt the need to write one for his eyeshadow primer specifically. I bought the Naked Palette 6 months ago and a sample of all four versions of the UD's Primer Potion is given with the purchase. I never really thought much of eyeshadow primer since I was fairly new to make up and didn't realize how important it was to actually making your eyeshadow last, but I was happy nonetheless because it was free product!

The first time I used it I was happy to see how long it lasted and decided that I would continue to use it in place of my ELF one since it blended better onto my brown skintone. I've been hooked ever since.

I've somehow managed to make the sample sizes last until now and I still have a good amount of the original, matte and sin ones left. However, once I finally run out of the samples I'm going to have to book it to Sephora (or urbandecay.com if I'm feeling lazy) and buy it immediately.

I can honestly say that if you're looking for a primer that will make your eyeshadow last, this is the one.

The minute I tried using it though, the wand left a big scratch on my eyelid. The soft fabric part of the wand doesn't completely cover the plastic tip. So now I can't use the wand even if I WANTED to because it physically hurts and scratches my skin.

But my most recent purchase had a wand applicator which made application of the product messy and difficult. Secondly, the wand compromises the sterility/cleanliness of the product which forces us to re-dip the wand that has just been contaminated by our eyelid. Understandably,  as with mascara we should discard it after 3 months to avoid having it harbor bacteria. It seems this is their intentions by changing the packaging.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I wanted to use this a while before reviewing. I have had this mascara almost 2 months now. I was a bit hesitant to buy expensive mascara, my last drugstore hold, but after spending a long time reading reviews decided on this. I am an allergy sufferer so I need something that is waterproof. I have decided this is AMAZING mascara. The best part, to me, is the lightness of the formula. So many mascaras weigh down lashes. My lashes stay curled with this. The stay is good, I don't find it smears. I'm not sure it would hold up in the pool, I will find out soon, but I'm not that concerned about that. I find it lengthens and defines nicely. I don't think one coat does much for volumizing, but I have thick lashes so that is fine with me. If volumizing is important to you, I don't think this is the right mascara.

I felt like I bought an expensive dried up eyeliner with a very fancy precise tip. It's too bad it isn't wet enough ): would have loved it. It's only useful now for adding a small defined minuscule cat eye flick at the end but that would be just adding one more unnecessary step in my makeup routine and too expensive to buy again for just that purpose.

In hot, humid Texas weather (103 degrees plus 90% humidity...) you need something to help your makeup last instead of melting/sweating off and this was pretty decent. I also like that it's oil free.

My only complaint is that is dries up fairly quickly. Only after a short number of times using the product it starts to dry up. I have to keep several of them cap down in my jar so that when the liner stops working I can switch to another pen while that one is ""reinking"". When the pens are new they work amazing. Its only after Ive used them a while that they start to dry up. Also, you can't tell when you're getting low.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,Humidity in Chicago in the summer can reach the 105's and this little baby held my makeup all day and night!

This mascara hoewever, has been able to defy gravity! I match it with my Shu Uemura eye lash curler before applying. After applying Cannonball however, I also add a thickening mascara to the tips of my lashes to make them pop more since this is purely for lengthening/waterproof and gives -->NO THICKENING<-- at all.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I love the brush tip - it's possibly one of the most precise applications for a liquid liner I've ever tried. It doesn't feel stiff, but it doesn't bend and mess up your line. Also, this liner doesn't cake on itself and wipe itself off. I mean that usually when I apply liquid liner, even when I wait for it to dry, sometimes the fine crease along my lash line will ""crack"" the liner - but this liner doesn't do that. Also, if you go over the same line more than once, it doesn't build on itself and wipe itself off, if that makes sense.

My only complaint is the intensity of the pigment. I have very black eyelashes, so I need the blackest and most intense possible color in order for liquid liner to look dramatic on my eyes. I wish I could take the color intensity of Stila's liquid liner and put it inside this Kat Von D liner. As the liner wasn't dark enough, I ended up returning it.

I tried the waterproof version of this liner on my hand at the store, and it's a wonderful dark color, but it's shiny and reflective, which also reduces the intensity too much for me. Still on a search for the perfect liquid liner.",27 04 2015,3 stars,"Great application, but not dark enough",https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,2.83E+18

Urban Decay,Eyeshadow Primer Potion - Original,Eye Primer,"I was skeptical about how much of a difference this product would make but I was very pleasantly surprised.

It's really easy to apply; it just glides on and rubs in very smoothly and you're good to go. But the most amazing thing about ths product is the difference it makes in your eyeshadows' color and pigmentation, With this primer, the color is far richer and more highly pigmented than it would be without the primer so I really feel like I'm getting my money's worth out of my eyeshadows. One caveat though: you have to make sure you apply this product everywhere on your browbone and eyelid and apply it evenly or you'll end up with spots on your lid that are lighter that the colors of the rest of your eye. This product creates a creaseless, highly pigmented, professional finish that lasts all day long. I use it everyday and would recommend it to everybody.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Wow!! I personally am not a big fan of waterproof mascaras, however I bought this so I could wear it to Disneyland and not have mascara run all around my eyes. This is absolutely amazing! I used to use the Lancôme Hypnose mascara and the Tarte mascara, but after I switched to this, I never looked back. I have very short, straight lashes, and unfortunately, I am cursed with uneven eyelids. One is a mono and one is a double, so one set of eyelashes grows up while the other grows down. When I curl this with my Shiseido curler, it holds SO WELL. It keeps the curl however I left it! It's also EXTREMELY waterproof. I went swimming in a chlorine pool with this mascara on and not a trace of it was around my eyes when I came out of the water. Amazing! Plus, it's one of the less expensive mascaras at Sephora. It is worth the buy!

A primer helps, and applying from base to tip while moving the wand from side to side and allowing it to dry before touching up.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I have super straight eye lashes like most of Asian girls. Thankfully at least I have relatively thick and long lashes, base on the criteria of Asian girls, my the biggest concern is water proof and curling. It holds my curl all day long. More it doesn't turn me into raccoon after work out. Even it is super strong, cleansing wasn't that hard for me. It may vary by what kind of product you use, though. The only cons of this product is fiber which also can be pro. It falls off on cheek or in my eyes, sometimes. Not crazily, since I'm using fresh product. But I presume that it would be getting harder when the product itself starts to get dried.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"The ""Great"": It is very long lasting, non-creasing, smudge-proof (even without a primer underneath), and the tip is thin for precision and multiple strokes.

The ""not Perfect"": I found myself having to recap the pen and shaking it way too many times to get more color. I'd use it, and after a few strokes it started to dry out. I had to shake it a couple more times, go back to my eye, then shake it at least one more time. When I'm in a rush in the morning, those are precious wasted seconds shaking it.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I like this for everyday- I feels like another step to my skincare routine. Its a lightweight gel-lotion that smells lovely and absorbs quickly. Really hydrates, and does help my foundation go on well. ALSO- it has excellent skincare ingredients (seriously, wow). I think it's good for dry/normal/combo skin.It doesn't necessarily help prolong my foundation, though. It primes the foundation to go on evenly and is good for your skin but isn't a ""make your makeup last 24 hrs"" or ""make your face look airbrushed"" kind of primer. 

If you want a little more radiance, or something even more hydrating, the new First Aid Beauty Coconut Face Smoothie is what I prefer. It has 1.7 fl oz, making it much much cheaper.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I held two VERY strong beliefs until I was 34:

1) Designer brands are usually not ANY better than less expensive brands (some are arguably worse) and 

2) The even more firmly held belief (based on LOTS of experience) that eyeliners and mascaras were not worth paying more than drug store prices for. MOST shishi brands that I've tried are actually nowhere near as GOOD as drug store brands - they never glide on, they dry out easily, they usually don't last even half as long and I have to practically rip into my eyelid to get any pigment going (where as drug store brands - one slide over, and as long as you didn't goof up your line, you're good to go.)

Enter Marc Jacobs.

I originally purchased the mini trio of these (which if they're still selling - go. Go buy them now. I'll wait) just to try them out, forever on a quest to find a shishi eyeliner or mascara that was mind-blowingly different.

I bought the minis maybe 6 months ago? I use them all at least once a week, I abuse them thoroughly, and they are MINI. Yet! I still have them, they still go on smooooothly and yay for PIGMENT. (Sidenote: the bronze looking one, I think it's called cocoa, always gets me compliments. I don't even have to do anything cool. I could put a dot in the middle of my eyelid, call it a day, and someone would comment on what a pretty color it is.)

So it is with a mix of happiness and sadness (before I tried these I was spending $8-$12 on eyeliner, after all) that I tell you these are the best. eyeliners. ever.",27 12 2016,5 stars,The. Best.

This mascara doesn't smudge or flake during the day, and it looks SO NATURAL! You can definitely add more coats for a more dramatic look, but one coat is perfect for that natural-defined lash look.

When on lid, they look like eyeshadow instead of liner was placed there. My tip for lids, put them on your lash line then take an eyeliner like trooper or whatever and draw under the MJ.
Honestly, if these were marketed what they are, eyeshadow pencils , I wouldn't be as disappointed as I am. I just find, at this price point, there are much better pencils for less, like the MUFE liners.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Needed this mascara because my oldest child was graduating from high school and I knew I'd be emotional. :) It was highly recommended by a Sephora staffer.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"This is my HG pencil liner! There is about 30 seconds-1 minute of play time before it sets to a VERY long lasting finish. It also wears lovely in the tightline/waterline with minimal transfer. I like to apply this straight to my lashline & then smudge it into a wing with an angled brush. The formula is perfect for this technique! My liner looks only slightly worn by the time I wash my face at night, even on sweaty gym days! I've also worn this swimming in the ocean & as long as I don't rub my eyes, the liner doesn't budge. I have blaquer, (th)ink, brown out, and jazzberry. I love them all and I want mooooore. P.S. Some have shimmer, some have glittler, some are matte. I recommend swatching to see the true finish.",28 05 2015,5 stars,Best pencil liner ever!,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,7.36E+18
Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"This is the mascara I wear at horse shows and every day that I ride. It's extremely hot and humid here in the Miami, FL area. I've had mascaras literally melt off of my lashes, especially when I'm sweating on horseback. This formula is thickening but doesn't clump, it's remarkably lengthening, and if I twirl the brush when applying it I don't need to curl my lashes to get great lift! But, the best thing is that I get all of those effects in a formula that doesn't melt, smear, or run in heat, humidity, and sweat! I've yet to test it when swimming, but when I do, I'll post an update! This is the BEST waterproof EVER!!!! Thank you, Urban Decay!!!

I found this liner to be great, I was a little unsure when I saw it was like a felt tip as I thought it would apply quite weakly but I was impressed with how dark it came out on my skin.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Black eyeliner is the important makeup item for me. I've been through dozens of brands and styles. This one is the best for throwing in your bag on a night out. It doesn't bleed, lasts hours, applies with the perfect amount of pressure, and does't crack/peel/chunk/rip out my eyelashes like other waterproof brands have.

Stila,Stay All Day® Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I appreciate that Sephora hires some women over 50 who know what works for older women. It's intimidating to approach a beauty counter staffed by only 20-somethings. My salesperson understood my need for an eyeliner that's easy to use and does not smudge on older skin. To be honest, I'd been in twice before asking for waterproof liner and had been guided to make two purchases that did not live up to their claims. I guess I tried again at Sephora because generally I've been pleased with your service, and because there was a salesperson who looked closer to my age on the third try!

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I decided to try this as I was looking for a waterproof, cruelty-free mascara and have heard good things about this mascara. The formula is light so it holds curl well and is a nice, dark black. With one coat, it is very legnthening, but not very volumnizing (though it builds up nicely without clumping). The waterproof aspect is okay. I've tested it out swimming a few times and it stays on (though you lose some curl, obviously). Since it has fibers, it can flake a little. If you are just looking for a mascara that doesn't run when you cry, tear up, have allergic reactions, etc. then this will work great.

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I don't really get the hype around this primer; it doesn't do much. I mean, it's nice that it's water based, not silicone based, and I get that I wouldn't have as extreme of an effect as something silicone based, but I feel no difference in my skin after I put it on, and my foundation looks and feels the same with or without it. If anything, it makes it worse. I don't know if it only does this in combination with my moisturizer or foundation, but I've noticed (whether I use a beauty blender or a brush) that it starts pilling off my face when I try to blend my foundation with it. My foundation doesn't do that with any other primer except for this one. So unless you don't mind wasting 40 dollars or you just want to buy it so you can put it on your vanity, don't buy this primer. Not worth the price.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"Love this setting spray! It's a tad pricey but TOTALLY worth it!

The thing is, I'm a sweaty gal. Not like a waterfall on my face sweaty but more of like a fine sheen over my face sweaty. When I'm at work, I'm always running back and forth from the kitchen to the cashier area so I do work up quite a sweat. I always had to retouch my foundation and I always had terrible raccoon eyes. After using this spray, my foundation stayed put and my eye makeup didn't run after a 6 hour workday! Totally worth the price!

If you don't want to spend $30 on it right away, try the travel size of this that's $11. They usually have them near the cashiers.

How to use: (at least how I use it)
After putting on my foundation and letting my mascara dry, 3 sprays do the job. One spray for my forehead/eye area (close your eyes when you spray this!), one for my right cheek, another for my left cheek.

I have combination skin that's more oily in the summer, and seriously, my makeup did not budge.
The bad: I could feel it not budging? My face felt sort of tight and weird for horus - it felt like hairspray on my skin. I only used it twice, and it didn't make my face break out either time, but I really can't imagine that something that feels like it's stopping your skin from breathing can be good for it.

It’s not completely off putting to the point where I can’t stand the scent but I much prefer the scent of their peach primer. I tend to reach for the spray version of this primer (the 3-in-1) way more often because it leaves my face feeling refreshed and I can spritz it on while on the go.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Best liner EVER. I went to sephora to purchase this after I saw all of the great reviews on here, You chicas were right, this liner is phenominal. The tip allows very detailed and preciese lines, its very easy to make a subtle thin line or even a cat eye. I previously purchased Stila's stay all day water proof liner but it kept feathering and it was too glossy. This i'm glad to say goes on more matte. It last too. I wore it on a hot humid new york day were I was helping host a gathering and this did not budge not one bit.
*One note I have to say, this went on VERY sheer when I first bought it, it almost looked gray. Ladies just swipe it a few times on your hand to get the ink/pigment flowing. I saw a few reviews that say this wasnt pigmented but it really is, just remember to swipe it a few times when you first purchase it so the liquid comes down.

So I invested in this spray for her.

Her comments :

1. It does hold Make-up on beautifully
2. The spray darkens eyebrow pencil color though
3. And it's mildly shiney - a light powdering fixes that

So far this is the best product we've found out there - only problem is # 2 above.

Other products are stickey and excessively shiney.

Until we find one that keeps her exact eyebrow color - this is it !!!

It went on easily and only took two coats, which is what I do with my usual mascara. The brush had surprisingly short bristles, but they still defined the lashes nicely. I gave it four stars instead of five because I prefer a more volumizing mascara, but this still turns out nicely. It also makes my bottom lashes look flawless! Would definitely recommend.

I tried this before I tried the de-slicking one and let me tell you, it's there for a reason! If you have oily skin, I would not recommend this product. It's not that it necessarily makes it worse, but oily skin itself tends to make makeup run. This product, not being one to help with oil, is not a good idea for people who have oily skin.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Creating a winged eyeliner look is often time consuming and difficult until you really get the hang of it, but even then, most of those flimsy brush applicator tips have minds of their own and tend to make the process quite a hassle. I love a nice dramatic cat eye, but I would often stray away from creating the look unless I had ample time. That was the case until i decided to purchase Kat's Tattoo Liner. The applicator tip is stiff enough to give control, but supple enough to glide and curve smoothly for a seamless application. The pigment is build-able, so in the rare moments that the formula comes out a bit light, I give it a second to dry and go over the spot again to make it opaque. Another awesome aspect of the applicator is that the tip goes to a fine, tapered point, so you can angle it to create either a thick line or a fine point for a cat eye!",29 10 2015,5 stars,Cat Eyes Have Never Been Easier,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-8.39E+18

Dont get me wrong! the first couple times you use it, its amazing!! 
BUT Ive noticed a couple things: 
I have oily eyelids sometimes and when my eyelids are oily, the eyeliner tends to come off. Another thing is, the felt tip gets ruined easily. If you wear a lot of eyeshadow, the eyeshadow gets on the tip and dries it out even more quickly.  

I once also opened one of the stila liners at the same time as kvd liner and used both every day (one for each eye) just for fun and the stila became unusable in a shorter amount of time.

You can manage both thin and thick lines hassle free. It's not as hard to layer if you need to as other liners that sometimes wont. The black color gives a nice, dark line that i LOVE. Easily removed with warm water even in the shower.

The packaging is great too. It's slim & light weight, also decorative & cute!

My lashes came out super defined, and it's pretty good at lengthening too. The brush is big and at first I thought it would get in the way, but it helped the mascara go on full and thick.
For reference, I've tried Benefit BADgal, Clinique High Impact and Lash Doubling, Lancome Hypnose and Definicils, and all the popular volumizing drugstore mascaras out there.

I would also recommend for people with lashes like mine to keep the first coat thin and light, and built up a heavier one for the second coat. I've only had this in my collection for about two weeks, and I'm more than certain it will stay for a very long time!! Love it!

Not only is this soothing and hydrating, it brought my skin back to life. Im not oily like i thought i would be and dewy looks dont scare me anymore.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I will admit that I was reluctant to try Kat Von D products initially because I am always afraid that a celebrity-backed brand will attempt to glide on the fame/notoriety rather than the quality of the products themselves. However, I was thankfully proven wrong.

Tattoo liner is an apt name as the color glides on like ink, fully pigmented and dark (in the case of black, which I own), and water is no problem. I find this far easier to use than liquid liners that use brushes, mostly because they go on thicker and take a few seconds to dry, in which time I have blinked and smudged all over my upper lid. With this felt tip, which is soft and pliable, I am able to achieve fine marker precision with great color payoff and much less unsightly smudging.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking for well-defined eyes.…read more",30 03 2012,5 stars,LOVE,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,-6.91E+18

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"Oh. My. Gahd. 

I am never buying another liquid liner again. I've been using drugstore eyeliners for a few years now, and wasn't necessarily unhappy, but I have been using liquid liner more and more, so I decided to give a higher-end one a try.

Was in between this, Stila's, and Benefit's push up liner. I can't speak to the others, but I'm never trying another one.

The color payoff on this is amazing. You barely have to touch your eyelid. But the brush tip is easy to maneuver, sort of like the felt tip ones I've used in the past. I draw the wing first, then start from the inside and trace along my eyelid. I dont even drag it, i just lightly press it, pick it up, and continue pressing until I reach the wing. The color is that great.

PLUS I've worn it all day, gone out at night, danced at a sweaty bar, gone to sleep (I know, I know) and woken up with my eyeliner STILL ON POINT. i dont know a single drugstore liner that can do that without flaking off or smearing.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I got this as my birthday gift this year and it is AMAZING, but only as a waterline liner. At first I tried to use it as a regular eyeliner & was super annoyed as I couldn't get it to be very sharp, even at the first try. And because it's a turn-out eyeliner you can't sharpen it so it's not like it will ever be sharp again. So I will keep using my Kat Von D tattoo liner as my primary liner. But this works great as a waterline liner. It doesn't smudge for hours on end. I wore it all day & it stayed! Where other waterline liners will run on me after 4-5 hours, this was fine for over 12 hrs. I even went to sleep with it on and in the morning it disappeared but I didn't look like a racoon at least.

So you know, not great as a regular liner (though it did last on my very oily lids, so who knows, maybe if you like thick eyeliner & don't care about smudgey looks...)

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I usually never take the time to write reviews, but definitely felt I had to for this mascara! I have tried countless brands of mascara searching for one that did it all for me - I wanted length, volume, and curl (something that seems impossible for me to get or last throughout the day). After reading the reviews on this mascara I was so excited to try it! In my opinion it is one of the best mascaras I've tried! The formula is perfect, not too wet like some can be, but not dry either... Cannonball's formula makes application very easy and with a couple swipes my eyelashes looked the best I've ever seen them look! Even my husband noticed at dinner - he asked me if I used a different mascara and then asked if I applied false lashes too... that's much of a difference this mascara made for me. The curl has been going strong for 5 hours now and usually my lashes hold no curl. I notice no flaking or smudging either. I know products work differently for everyone, but for me this seems to be the formula I've been looking to find for quite some time now! 5 stars in my book!

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"Wore this to a rock festival in Florida, there was a ton of humidity, lots of drinking, dancing and sweating and rubbing at my eyes because dust got in there and this didn't move at all. I find when I wear waterproof mascaras on my lower lashes they tend to flake because they're so dry but this didn't happen. I've never tried this on my upper lashes so I cant comment on that. The only downfall to this mascara is that the stopper broke so there's way too much mascara on the wand so I have to scrape it off.

Urban Decay,Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"After trying the waterproof versions of Diorshow (left horrible rings under my eyes just from walking around during the day, so can't imagine what would happen in H2O) and Phenomen'eyes (waterproof, but also gloppy, clumpy, left my lashes stuck together like spikes), I decided to give Cannonball a shot. And it's great! I feel like waterproof formulas are always a little sticker than regular mascara, but this lengthens and fans my lashes out beautifully and it definitely stays on all day without smudging, even on the most humid and sweaty of days. The only thing I don't love is the smell ... I'm not surprised it's waterproof, because it smells like you're coating your lashes in melted down vinyl pool floats and old tires. Blech. Once you close the tube the smell goes away, though, so I can deal. Overall it's definitely the best waterproof mascara I've tried so far.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I received a sample tube of the MJ mascara and it was incredible, so I've been trialing some of their other things as well. I bought this in Ro(cocoa) because I was looking for a mostly natural colour to wear every day. It's a little more red gold than Brown Out, which I will try when this runs out.
It glides on incredibly smoothly. The only thing I can compare the application to would be Tarte's SmolderEyes. Very soft, gel-like and just like butter!
Unlike the Tarte though, this thing is bomb proof on me. Every liner and mascara I have ever used has smudged on me by the 4 o' clock, but this stays exactly where I put it. It does fade very slightly, but much less than other liners I've used. You can smudge it if you want right off the bat, and then it's on until you take it off. A bonus is that you don't need to remove either one with WP eye makeup remover; a micellar water works fine on both. I don't understand this magic, but it's my ideal scenario!
The only caution I'd give is if you're very particular about your colours. I've noticed that if I reapply this for evening, I have two distinct colours of liner for a minute or two until the second application oxidizes. On application, the colour is more gold, reddish brown, and it oxidizes to more of a plain brown, which works for my purposes.

The highest praise I can give right now is that this eyeliner is what I'm planning to use for my wedding makeup. The next liner I want to try is MJ's precision pen, for days I need to look more awake or would like a bit of a wing, because this doesn't give a very defined look.",30 07 2014,5 stars,I've thrown out all my other pencil liners,https://www.sephora.com/product/highliner-gel-crayon-P379434?icid2=products%20grid:p379434,4.58E+18

It also dries too fast on the eyelid, so if you need to go over a spot again, it's like a dry erase marker. Additionally, it smudges on my eyelids (I almost have monolids though).

I always end up with panda eyes no matter what eye primer I used.
Then come these beautiful babies, I have Th(Ink) which looks like dark purple in real life, Intro (vert) GORGEOUS color!, and N(Ice) that I use on my inner corner.
Pros:
-They glide on effortlessly which scared me at first because creamy means smudge, but to my surprise they stay on even without primer. I fell asleep on them today (which wasn't a good thing to sleep with makeup on) but no smudge!

It also started cakeing up and crumbling while I was wearing it... Bizarre!

The formula is great; I have been using it every day for about two months now and have not experienced any smudging or transferring. However, my main issue is with the tip of the pen. For the first couple of uses, the tip is very sharp and precise, which helps me get a nice wing. After some time, the pen tip has actually started to crumble off and become very dull. It is difficult for me to get a sharp wing, and I find that I have to finesse it with my finger nail every time. I’ve used more than one of these eyeliners, and they’ve all given me the same problem.

Marc Jacobs,Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner,Gel Eyeliner,"I am, in general, a big fan of Marc Jacobs' beauty line. I like the colors, the textures and the packaging of most of the products I've tried. The one exception is this gel liner.

It's got a very saturated pigmentation, which is great. All the colors, including the black are very true and flattering. But, unfortunately, there's no creaminess to the formula and it sets incredibly quickly, so blending is almost impossible. Strangely, I found this particularly true with the black, the other colors I tried were not as bad, but not completely without this problem, either.

What's more, after just a few weeks, my black pencil got very clumpy when applied, so I had little flecks of product that were just dried out and wouldn't budge on my lids.

I returned the black pencil, thinking I just had a dud or somehow it had been exposed to air or something, but the second one I tried did the same thing.

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I love the brush tip on this liner as opposed to the felt tip found on most other pen style liquid liners. I find it easy to get that precision that we are all looking for in a liner. Also that it lasts longer since the brush doesn't get gunked up like felt tips with the product that's underneath making them chunky and uneven and just hard to work with. I do find that if I'm wearing a really chunky, glittery shadow underneath when I apply the liner then due to the consistency of it, it can mix in with the pigment and not look quite opaque enough on the first stroke. However if I just wait about 3 seconds and let the first coat dry and just go over it a second time then that problem is fixed! I am a liner junkie and I love this one.

I bought this in Moss, it's a fantastic alternative for black for my really light skin. It is noticeably dark green up close, but far away you can't really notice. The product is very opaque and dries with a semi-glossy finish quite quickly. If you make a mistake, a slightly damp q tip can erase mistakes without giving that terrible stain which can rin the rest of the look.

Other products instantly lose the curl I've just obtained with the eyelash curler. Not this one. This mascara holds the curl and gives me knock-out eyes.

I was worried that it would be harsher on my eyelashes because it's waterproof, and a lot of people say to only use waterproof mascara for weddings or swimming for that reason. However, as long as you use a good eye makeup remover (Neutrogena or baby oil) that isn't rough on your eyes, you'll be fine.

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"I used Benefit's ""Bad Gal"" mascara for years but decided to try something new because it seems like their formula is not as thick or they don't give as much as they used to. I tried Benefit's ""They're Real"" waterproof mascara (Sephora's best selling mascara), I didn't like it. It was too sticky and after a few coats all my eyelashes were starting to stick together and it gave me that crooked spider leg look which didn't look or feel good.

I came across this ""Diorshow"" mascara by Dior and what caught my eye at first was the thick brush, I must have a good thick brush like this because I like to layer on mascara until I get the perfect thickness. I had to get waterproof because that's all the had. I usually don't use waterproof because I find it stickier and it doesn't layer as well but if that's my only option I'll get it.

I really love this mascara because it applies nicely, has a good thick formula, lasts a long time, has no weird or strong smell, and is a dark black. If you get a little on your face or hands while applying, it comes off easily. I use make-up remover wipes to get it off my eyelashes at the end of the day and it comes off quick and easy.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"I bought this because I got tired of turning my husband brown every time we kissed and his nose touched my face (it's ok to laugh).

Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I've hopped around for years between gel eyeliners and liquid. I love the control I get from gel but nothing is ever black enough. If there is a very specific look, I'll use it, but for every day I prefer liquid.
I've gone back and forth, back and forth between Kat Von D's tattoo liner and Stila's liner for years. I've just come to accept that I love Kat's better. I really do think it's personal preference because my best friend feels exactly the opposite. For me, I like the applicator better. It is smoother on application and the tip bends just right without overshooting product. It's super black, matte and lasts all day. Gives a perfect wing with it's super point too. I really do think it's the best.…read more",31 10 2015,4 stars,Always go back,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,9.05E+18
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I read all the reviews and was expecting this liquid liner to be the best but I was sadly disappointed. The tip is like a makeup brush and sways back and forth hard to give you a perfect line, also very little product comes out and the pigment is not that great. When I kept trying to add more on top of the line to make it darker and more even on my eyelid it would actually take away the original line. The black is a very dull black. I have honestly used better drug store brands then this liner. Sorry love Kat Von D but to me this product is not good or worth the money.",31 10 2016,1 star,wanted to love it,https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205?icid2=products%20grid:p245205,2.02E+18
Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,I am an extremely oily person so I am not sure if anything will keep my makeup  the way I want it to but this does a decent job. Does it set my makeup? Yes. Does it stop my oilyness? No. But I am not sure if it claims to be mattifying and recommended for oily skin so I guess it does it's job.,31 10 2016,4 stars,Love It,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,4.37E+18

Dior,Diorshow Waterproof Mascara,Mascara,"For years I've been using Dior's DiorShow Waterproof Mascara and though I've tried many others, I still think this one is the best. It lengthens and thickens and does not smudge no matter how much water gets on my lashes. BUT THAT'S NOT THE BEST PART! The best thing about this product is that this mascara holds curl very well. I religiously curl my short, straight, Asian lashes daily prior to applying mascara. The problem is that other mascaras are heavy on the lashes and they cause me to lose the curl. I hate curling my lashes after applying mascara because my lashes break easily and the curler gets gunky. This is the only mascara that I've used in all my years that does not compromise the curl after I've used a curler. Even the nonwaterproof version can NOT do it.

I cannot recommend any other mascara other than this one. It is simply the best.",31 12 2011,5 stars,Can't get any better,https://www.sephora.com/product/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-P99901?icid2=products%20grid:p99901,-5.52E+18

It is hard to blend sometimes with this primer but what I do is let it set in while I either do my face makeup and by then the shadows blend beautifully!

Too Faced,Hangover Replenishing Face Primer,Primer,"I actually got this because i was looking for a better primer, to help me keep my foundation in place because my skin is oily and acne prone most of the time. for the past few months i had been getting little breakouts randomly all over.
with all the rating and everyone talking about this primer, i decided to try it out, and literally the first day i put it on my skin felt so soft and not oily. for the first time i had a matte face without having to powder it... with using this primer for about 3 weeks now i can say its helped me a lot, now my skin is super soft and so healthy. i know this is meant to be a primer but i actually use it as a moisturizer... my breakouts have cleared up and my skin looks flawless...honestly my favorite right now... i hope too faced comes up with a skin care line!! there is no product I have been unsatisfied with.",31 12 2014,5 stars,If it has coconut.....its gotta be good!!!,https://www.sephora.com/product/hangover-replenishing-face-primer-P387589?icid2=products%20grid:p387589,1.80E+17
Kat Von D,Tattoo Liner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I never found any liquid eyeliner better than this. Everybody raves about the Stila eyeliner but I'm not really a fan of the felt tip. I very much prefer the brush applicator of Kat Von D Tattoo Liner! It gives me such precise lines and when it sets, it does not move (unless you use makeup remover)! I showed my friends this by applying this on the back of my hand and waiting for it to dry and use my finger to rub it really hard. All of them are amazed that it still did not fade at all.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"At first, I thought makeup setting sprays were a product that had more of a placebo effect than real results. I bought the 1 oz to try during my summer spent in Europe. It was ridiculously humid and this spray did miracles for my makeup! I was out nearly every day for the entire day, walking, eating, etc. I was NOT willing to lug around makeup for touchups in my little crossbody bag, and with a few spritzes of All Nighter in the morning over my full face of makeup, I did not have to! What a lifesaver. My skin is very oily and I worried it would make me look shiny, but alas it did not. Normally I don't write reviews but this product really blew me away.

Urban Decay,All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray,Setting Spray,"This product is great at keeping makeup on for long periods of time, and beautifully sealing powder. I have normal/dry skin and when layered over my foundation and powder this product makes my complexion appear satiny and seamless.

However, do not use over liquid foundation if you have not set it with powder. This will make your skin appear blotchy and emphasize your pores.",31 12 2015,5 stars,I always repurchase,https://www.sephora.com/product/all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-P263504?icid2=products%20grid:p263504,6.99E+18
FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA,Flyliner Longwear Liquid Eyeliner,Liquid Eyeliner,"I really wanted to love this liner. So many reviews and discussions with friends made it seem promising.
Being Asian, I don’t have fully visible eyelids. 
I found the formula took too long to dry and over the course of the day, smudged everywhere, even when I used a primer and foundation. I found the felt tip a tad bit long, so you don’t get the precision for a clean line unless you go super slow and have a steady hand. That combined with the runnier formula, was frustrating and had me continuously fixing what I had just done.
I tried for several weeks and ended up switching to the Dior liner, which is more expensive but dries quickly and lasts all day.",31 12 2018,2 stars,"<img src=""https://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2094258+sw.jpg"" alt="""" class=""css-1ctithg "" role=""presentation"" data-comp=""Image Box"">Color: Cuz I'm Black",https://www.sephora.com/product/flyliner-longwear-liquid-eyeliner-P17876556?icid2=products%20grid:p17876556,-3.43E+18
